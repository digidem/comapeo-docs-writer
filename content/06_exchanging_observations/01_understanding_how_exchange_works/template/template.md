# Understanding How Exchange Works
For [Version Data]

Exchange is how CoMapeo devices share and synchronize data with each
other, ensuring everyone in a project has the same information.
**Step 1**
Open the Exchange screen from the menu.
**Step 2**
Select whether you want to exchange
**everything** (all media) or **previews
only** (lighter data use).
**Step 3**
Make sure devices are on the same Wi-Fi
network, or use **Remote Archive** to
exchange over the internet
