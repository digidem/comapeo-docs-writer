# Inviting Collaborators
For [Version Data]

When mapping on your own, there are three ways to start collaborating
with others using CoMapeo.
-   Inviting a Collaborator to My Solo Project
-   Starting a New Project
-   Joining an Existing Project
# Inviting a Collaborator to My Solo Project

When mapping on your own, your first project is simply My Solo Project
to which you can gather a limitless amount of observations. If you'd
like to share observations in My Solo Project using CoMapeo's Exchange
feature, then you will first need to give the project a name. Once the
project has been successfully renamed, then you are ready to invite
devices to this renamed project and use the Exchange feature.
**Step 1**
Go to the Menu screen to start.
**Step 2**
Tap on the Invite button in the Current
Project card.
**Step 3**
Review the quick summary about inviting
collaborators and tap on Name My Project
when ready.
**Step 4**
On Name My Project, enter a clear and
concise project name and tap on Save when
done.
**Step 5**
When the project is successfully renamed
and saved, your project is then ready to
Invite Devices for collaboration.
# Starting a New Project

In the case where you want to share any observations from My Solo
Project, but would rather collaborate with another device on a separate
project, then Start a New Project.
**Step 1**
Go to the Menu screen to start.
**Step 2**
Tap on All Projects in the list below the
Current Project card.
**Step 3**
On the All Project screen, tap on the Start
New Project button.
**Step 4**
Enter a clear and concise project name and
tap on Create when done.
**Step 5**
When the project is successfully named and
created, your new project is ready to
Invite Devices for collaboration and My
Solo Project will still be available from
the All Projects screen.

-   **NEED TO ADD INSIGHTS FROM WIFI LEARNINGS HERE**. Like most apps
    that attempt to onboard large groups of people, CoMapeo struggles to
    onboard many devices at the same time. Here's how to address that:
