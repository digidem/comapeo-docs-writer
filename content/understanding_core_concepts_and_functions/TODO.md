Section/title: Understanding CoMapeo’s Core Concepts and Functions
Owner(s): <!-- add owner(s) -->
Date started: 2025-09-12

## Open questions
- [ ] Link targets for cross-references within ./content (to be added when those sections are drafted).
- [ ] Confirm any additional limits for media beyond audio 5-minute cap (not found centrally in context/).

## Missing details (to confirm from context)
- [ ] Validation process details for “Validated by CoMapeo” module (explicitly marked as TBD in context/).

## Decisions and rationale
- Provide a concise, high-level overview oriented to concepts and functions, with version-specific notes called out where context is explicit.

## Sources consulted (context only)

## Next steps
- [ ] Draft cross-links to related sections once available
- [ ] Add Sources line with exact paths (done)
- [ ] Run `context/AGENT_CONTENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- [ ] Keep filenames snake_case and assets linked relatively
