- What appears in the observations list and how it reflects exchanges. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- How editing permissions differ for participants and coordinators. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- How to start exporting observations or tracks from the list. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/data_export/index.md]

## Overview

The observations list is the hub for everything saved on your device, including entries exchanged from teammates. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md] Use it to scan recent observations and start exports when you need files outside CoMapeo.

## Core concepts

- The list shows every observation on the device, including ones received through Exchange. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Observations created on other devices display a blue line on the side. Participants can edit only the observations collected on their own device, while coordinators can edit all observations. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- The Download Observations button on this screen opens export options for all observations, observations with media, or tracks. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/data_export/index.md]

## Key flows

1. Open the observations list from the List tab in the bottom navigation to review recent entries and thumbnails. [Source: context/sources/screenshots/photo_4997224093216518211_y.txt]
2. Check the blue line indicator to confirm which observations came from other devices and whether you can edit them based on your role. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
3. Tap Download Observations to choose an export: All Observations (GeoJSON), All Observations with Media (ZIP with media and GeoJSON), or Tracks (GeoJSON), then share through your device’s options. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/data_export/index.md]
