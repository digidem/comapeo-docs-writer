# Onboarding

This is a required step to help configure devices to allow CoMapeo to use available features including storage and essential sensors like the camera and GPS. To keep this a easy experience, CoMapeo will request permission for additional sensor access the first time using specific features like tracks and audio. Included in onboarding are:

**Welcome Screen**
You will be invited to [Get Started] and asked for device permissions upon startup.

**Metrics & Privacy Policy**
The app will present the metrics it collects, and you can choose to [opt in] or [opt out]. This can also be changed later via **Settings > Data Privacy**.

See Privacy Policy in English : [CoMapeo Data & Privacy](https://www.notion.so/CoMapeo-Data-Privacy-d8f413bbbf374a2092655b89b9ceb2b0?pvs=21)

**Device Naming**
You must enter a name for the device. This is the name other devices will see when inviting you to project, and will display in the list of project members.
