## Reviewing a Category Set

To review CoMapeo’s included Category Set within the app itself follow steps for [creating an observation](/docs/creating-a-new-observation), [adding details](/docs/creating-a-new-observation#adding-details) and delete the observations saved as part of the exploration. 

 If this is the first time setting up a project and changing the categories set, it is likely your next step will be inviting collaborators  to gather data as a team.
