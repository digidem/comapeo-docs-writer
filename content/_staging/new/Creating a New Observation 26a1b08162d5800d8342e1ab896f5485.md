## Adding Details

Details are extra questions that are associated to each category. The specific information entered increases the quality data to help with reporting and evidence collection. Answering these questions is not required in order to save an observation. Follow your project protocol and data collection methodology to make sure data is gathered in the most useful way for the project needs. 

Details can also be completed after saving using  the :app-icon-edit: **Edit** tool

Go to 🔗 **Editing Observations**  (Link to editing instructions)

## Adding Audio

Adding audio recordings to Observations can provide context, serve as oral testimony, be evidence or data for monitoring purposes, or serve as an alternate manner to collect information on occasions when writing notes in CoMapeo is difficult or dangerous. 

Audio recordings will be associated with the notes, photos and GPS coordinates of the observation, and can later be exported or shared together with the other data. You can only add audio taken from within the CoMapeo app at the time you gather the observation, you can not add audio from other sources. 

Each audio recording can be up to 5 minutes long. You can add multiple audio recordings to a single observation.

## Saving an Observation

Save an observation by tapping the :app-icon-save-observation: blue checkmark at the top of the screen. Once an observation has been saved it will appear in the observation list and on the map screen. 

Information that is saved and cannot be changed is:

- GPS coordinates
- Date and time
- Observation metadata
- Photos taken when observation is saved

There are several other kinds of data that can be edited after an observation is saved. This is helpful for situations that require quick data collection, and thorough completion of descriptions and details.

🔗 Go to [**Editing Observations**](/docs/editing-observations) for more information. 

## Saving when GPS accuracy is low

GPS accuracy is a metadata property calculated by the GPS sensor in a device. It is based on information provided by satellites. This information is displayed in CoMapeo Mobile on the map screen and camera screen, left of the capture button. :app-icon-gps20: :comapeo-capture-photo:. It is also displayed in the :app-icon-coordinates:coordinated on the Create observation screen and will update until the observation is saved.

If the :app-icon-coordinates:coordinates have an accuracy of worse than ±10m or if there is no GPS signal at the time of saving the observation, CoMapeo offers three options. 

![Screenshot_20251029_111522_CoMapeo RC.jpg](Creating%20a%20New%20Observation/Screenshot_20251029_111522_CoMapeo_RC.jpg)

- **Continue waiting** until the GPS signal improves to get better accuracy. Time and slight maneuvers usually help. Checking the :app-icon-coordinates:coordinates until accuracy is better than ±10m, and tapping :app-icon-save-observation: then, will prevent the GPS warning from appearing again.
- **Save** to use the current GPS coordinates, even if accuracy is worse than ±10m.  Consider if this is satisfactory for the purpose of the data.
    
    <aside>
    💡
    
    **Tip:** If you save an observation without GPS coordinates, it will not appear on your map, but it will still appear in your observation list. 
    
    </aside>
    
- **Manual entry of coordinates** is a practical option only if you have access to another GPS device with better sensors and accuracy.  Alternative measures should be taken if data validation is important for the observation

---

## Manual entry of coordinates

Manual entry of coordinates is never an ideal situation but sometimes needed if a phone’s GPS sensor is not adequately reaching GPS satellites. This can happen in remote regions, under dense canopies, in buildings or when cloud cover is heavy.

<aside>
⚠️

**Warning:** CoMapeo cannot validate observations where coordinates have been manually entered. CoMapeo validated observations by including GPS metadata from sensors and attaching relevant data as Observation Metadata.  Observations without these details will display as unvalidated by CoMapeo

</aside>

<aside>
💡

**Tip:** An alternative for validating data is to :app-icon-add-photo:add a photo to the observation of the coordinates and precision displayed on a device with a better GPS signal. Do this *before* you enter coordinates.  
When submitting these observations for legal or scientific scrutiny, send the observation together with observation metadata and photo metadata.

### Step by Step

***Step 1:*** Select **MANUAL COORDS** to open the **Enter Coordinates** screen.

💡 **Tip:**  To return to the options tap the :app-icon-go-back: Back button

**Step 2:** Choose your **Coordinate Format**, to match the format of the other device.
Options include Decimal Degrees, Degrees/Minutes/Seconds or Universal Transverse Mercator.

***Step 3:*** Carefully read and copy coordinate details from the other device. **Enter required values** completing all fields. 

<aside>
⚠️

**Warning**: There is no way to edit the coordinate information entered after it is :app-icon-save-observation: saved .

</aside>

![GPS-manual-entry.jpg](Creating%20a%20New%20Observation/GPS-manual-entry.jpg)

***Step 4:*** Tap ****:app-icon-save-observation: **Save.**  The observation is saved with the coordinates at the same time.
