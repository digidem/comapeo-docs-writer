# **Understanding Projects**

Projects are how you organize your mapping work. They can be used for solo mapping or for collaboration with a team.

When you first open CoMapeo, can begin collecting observations in your own project right away.  you can edit its name and description to help you stay organized.

## Project data

- project info (name and description)
- team data
- observations (with associated media and metadata)
- tracks
- current category sets
- Remote archive settings (if used)

## Personal vs Collaborative Projects

A personal Project is automatically set up in CoMapeo when you first onboard. The P**roject Name** is the set to match the **Device Name** initially**.** It can be changed any time.

Collaborative projects are ones were people work as a team using CoMapeo to share project data. Exchange is the feature that makes it possible to gather and share data as a team, even when offline

## Multiple Projects

CoMapeo offers people the ability to work on multiple mapping and monitoring projects on a single device. This is useful for differentiating the type on information being gathered and working in different teams.

**Use CoMapeo securely with Multiple Projects.**

CoMapeo is engineered to keep data safe and organized, even when using a single device for more than one project

Data does not transfer between projects, and will not get mixed or modified if multiple projects are being used on any devices.
