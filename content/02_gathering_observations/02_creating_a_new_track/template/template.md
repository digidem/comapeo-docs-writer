# Creating a New Track
For [Version Data]

Tracks let you record paths or boundaries while moving through the
landscape. They are useful for mapping trails, rivers, borders, or
patrol routes.
**Step 1**
Open the Tracks menu (walking man icon).
The app may ask for GPS permission.
**Step 2**
Tap **Start Track** to begin recording your
path.
**Step 3**
As you move, CoMapeo will draw a line on
the map and log your observations along the
way.
**Step 4**
To stop, reopen the Tracks menu and tap
**Stop Track**. You can then name and save
it
# Projects

Projects are how you organize your mapping work. They can be used for
solo mapping or for collaboration with a team.
**Step 1**
When you first open CoMapeo, you begin in
"My Solo Project".
**Step 2**
To collaborate, rename your project and
invite other devices to join.
**Step 3**
Coordinators can invite collaborators,
manage settings, and enable features like
Remote Archive. Participants can contribute
Observations and Tracks
ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Since CoMapeo v5, you can now have **multiple projects** on
the same device without losing data
# Exchange

Exchange is how CoMapeo devices share and synchronize data with each
other, ensuring everyone in a project has the same information.
**Step 1**
Open the Exchange screen from the menu.
**Step 2**
Select whether you want to exchange
**everything** (all media) or **previews
only** (lighter data use).
**Step 3**
Make sure devices are on the same Wi-Fi
network, or use **Remote Archive** to
exchange over the internet
