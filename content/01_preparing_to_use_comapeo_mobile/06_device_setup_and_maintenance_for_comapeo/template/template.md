**Check Battery life**: To optimize battery life during data collection use flight mode. If possible bring an external battery pack and phone charging cable to recharge whilst in the field. Also try and make sure that other apps are not running in the background, draining your battery.

**Manage and maintain storage**

CoMapeo isn’t a large app, and the observation data (GPS coordinates and notes) don’t take up very much space. However if you start taking lots of photographs, or recording audio, these can begin to fill up your memory. 

- Manage your storage use by deleting unwanted apps within Settings > Apps > Sort by "Last used" or "Size".
- If you have lots of photos and videos in your phone gallery, consider moving them to an SD card or other storage.

### Protect your phone against physical damage

**Smartphone cases.**

Depending on your phone's durability, choose a case that offers appropriate protection for the environment in which you will be using it, ideally waterproof and shock-resistant.

**Weather Considerations.**

If you are working in environments with extreme heat or cold, bear in mind that these can also impact your phone. It might shut down at very high and very low temperatures.
