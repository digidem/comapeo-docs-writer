## Overview

CoMapeo is a digital mapping app for territory monitors that builds a private, collaborative mapping database by storing observations on devices. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md] After onboarding (welcome, privacy choice, and device naming), the app opens to the Map view so you can explore features. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md] If you plan to work with a team, create or join a project before you start collecting observations so everything stays aligned.

## Core concepts

- Projects and roles: A project keeps shared settings like the project name, verified devices, and the categories you use. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md] Coordinators manage project details and invites; Participants create and share observations but cannot change project settings. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md] Starting or joining a project first prevents losing observations later. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- Categories: CoMapeo ships with default categories. Coordinators can import a `.comapeocat` file to add custom categories, and those categories share with collaborators through project exchanges. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Observations: Each observation saves GPS coordinates, date, time, and any media you add. You can include a description, category-specific detail fields, photos, and optional audio recordings. Coordinates and timestamps cannot be edited after saving. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Tracks: Tracks capture movement from the Tracks option in the bottom navigation, letting you log paths alongside observations. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Exchange: Use Exchange from the Map screen to share data with devices on the same project and Wi-Fi network. Start Exchange to send and receive updates; stop or leave the screen to end the session once syncing finishes. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Key flows

1. Complete onboarding: accept permissions, choose whether to share metrics, and name the device so teammates can identify it. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
2. Set up your project: create or join a project before gathering data to keep observations tied to the right team. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
3. Start mapping: from the Map or Camera view, check GPS accuracy and tap the add button to create a new observation with the right category and details. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
4. Exchange regularly: when teammates are on the same Wi-Fi network and project, start Exchange to keep everyone up to date. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Notes

- Exchange requires all devices to have CoMapeo open on the same project and Wi-Fi network before syncing. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
