## What CoMapeo is

CoMapeo is a major upgrade to the Mapeo platform focused on reliability, performance, and security. It is powered by a new peer‑to‑peer database called “Mapeo Core”, which enables highly requested features such as GPS tracks and audio and video recording.

## How you start

On first launch you see a Welcome screen. After getting started, CoMapeo opens on the Map view where you can begin exploring features. [Source: context/sources/mega_deck/mega_deck_primary_template.txt]

## Core roles

CoMapeo uses two roles for teams: Project Coordinator and Project Participant. Coordinators invite devices that are on the same Wi‑Fi network and have the app open, and both devices must be on the same CoMapeo version. [Source: context/sources/mega_deck/mega_deck_primary_template.txt]

## Key features at a glance

- Observations and Photo Info: CoMapeo exposes observation location and photo metadata in a dedicated Photo Info view that you can review and share when needed. [Source: context/comapeo_support_materials/quickstart_guides/photo_data/index.md]
- Audio recordings and Tracks: Record audio for context and capture geo‑referenced tracks to document paths and boundaries. [Source: context/comapeo_support_materials/quickstart_guides/audio_tracks_map_file/index.md]
- Map File Picker: Add a single custom map from anywhere on your device into CoMapeo. [Source: context/comapeo_support_materials/quickstart_guides/audio_tracks_map_file/index.md]

![Exchange Settings entry point](../../../../context/sources/quickstart_guides/exchange_settings/images/screenshot_2025_07_24_at_11_08_47_am.png)

## Exchange and storage

Use Exchange to share data among devices. Exchange Settings let you choose between Exchange Everything and Exchange Previews Only to better manage disk space on low‑memory phones. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/exchange_settings/index.md]

## Security and privacy

Protect access to the app with App Passcode and use Obscure Passcode when needed. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/security_features/index.md]

## Remote Archive (Community Edition)

Add or remove a Remote Archive server and control how your device exchanges with that server. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/remote_archive/index.md]
