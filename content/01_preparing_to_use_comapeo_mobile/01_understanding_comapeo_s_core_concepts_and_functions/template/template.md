# Understanding CoMapeo's Core Concepts and Functions
For [Version Data]

-   Observations: Observations are the main way to collect information
    in CoMapeo. Besides the location, timestamp and category, they can
    also include photos, audios and details.
-   Tracks: Tracks let you record paths or boundaries as you move across
    the land. They are useful for documenting trails, patrol routes,
    rivers, or territory borders.
-   Projects: Projects organize your mapping work, either individually
    or with collaborators. They define the categories, team members, and
    settings for how data is collected and managed.
-   Exchange: Exchange is how devices share and synchronize project
    data. It allows collaborators to keep their observations up to date,
    even without internet access.
# Observations

Observations are the heart of CoMapeo. They allow you to capture data
about what you see in the field, including text, photos, audios, and
location.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can also add audio recordings to Observations to provide
context and narratives
# Tracks

Tracks let you record paths or boundaries while moving through the
landscape. They are useful for mapping trails, rivers, borders, or
patrol routes.
**Step 1**
Open the Tracks menu (walking man icon).
The app may ask for GPS permission.
**Step 2**
Tap **Start Track** to begin recording your
path.
**Step 3**
As you move, CoMapeo will draw a line on
the map and log your observations along the
way.
**Step 4**
To stop, reopen the Tracks menu and tap
**Stop Track**. You can then name and save
it
# Projects

Projects are how you organize your mapping work. They can be used for
solo mapping or for collaboration with a team.
**Step 1**
When you first open CoMapeo, you begin in
"My Solo Project".
**Step 2**
To collaborate, rename your project and
invite other devices to join.
**Step 3**
Coordinators can invite collaborators,
manage settings, and enable features like
Remote Archive. Participants can contribute

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Since CoMapeo v5, you can now have **multiple projects** on
the same device without losing data
# Exchange

Exchange is how CoMapeo devices share and synchronize data with each
other, ensuring everyone in a project has the same information.
**Step 1**
Open the Exchange screen from the menu.
**Step 2**
Select whether you want to exchange
**everything** (all media) or **previews
only** (lighter data use).
**Step 3**
Make sure devices are on the same Wi-Fi
network, or use **Remote Archive** to
exchange over the internet
