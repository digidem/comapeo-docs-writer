## In this page you will learn

- How to choose a device that runs CoMapeo offline.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/overview/faqs.md]
- What power, storage, and network gear to pack before fieldwork.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/training_and_information_sessions/preparing_equipment_and_supplies_for_a_training/recommended_equipment_and_supplies.md]

## Overview

Pick Android phones or tablets with enough power, storage, and protection to keep CoMapeo running offline.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/overview/faqs.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/mapeo_mobile_installation_setup/readme.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/mapeo_mobile_installation_setup/installing_mapeo_mobile.md] Bring chargers and routers or hotspots so Exchange works when there is no internet, and plan simple backup options for media and configs.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/troubleshooting/solving_sync_issues/creating_local_wi_fi_networks/with_a_portable_router.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/troubleshooting/solving_sync_issues/creating_local_wi_fi_networks/with_a_smartphone.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/training_and_information_sessions/preparing_equipment_and_supplies_for_a_training/recommended_equipment_and_supplies.md]

## Core concepts

- Android-only support — CoMapeo runs on Android 5.0+ devices; iOS is not supported.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/overview/faqs.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/mapeo_mobile_installation_setup/readme.md]
- Space matters — keep at least 1 GB free so the app installs and can store data.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/mapeo_mobile_installation_setup/installing_mapeo_mobile.md]
- Power and protection — charged batteries, portable chargers, and waterproof cases keep devices running in remote areas.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/mapeo_mobile_installation_setup/readme.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/essentials_for_a_successful_mapeo_project/planning/who_is_involved.md]
- Local networks — a portable router or spare phone hotspot lets teams Exchange without internet.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/troubleshooting/solving_sync_issues/creating_local_wi_fi_networks/with_a_portable_router.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/troubleshooting/solving_sync_issues/creating_local_wi_fi_networks/with_a_smartphone.md]

## Key flows

1. Confirm each device is Android 5.0+ with 1 GB free and virus-free.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/mapeo_mobile_installation_setup/readme.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/mapeo_mobile_installation_setup/installing_mapeo_mobile.md]
2. Charge devices and pack power strips, USB hubs, and portable chargers for the team.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/training_and_information_sessions/preparing_equipment_and_supplies_for_a_training/recommended_equipment_and_supplies.md]
3. Add protection and storage: sturdy cases, SD card/USB storage, and waterproofing as needed.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/essentials_for_a_successful_mapeo_project/planning/who_is_involved.md]
4. Set up offline sharing: bring a TP-LINK-style portable router or plan a spare phone hotspot for Exchange.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/troubleshooting/solving_sync_issues/creating_local_wi_fi_networks/with_a_portable_router.md; context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/troubleshooting/solving_sync_issues/creating_local_wi_fi_networks/with_a_smartphone.md]
5. Carry backup cables, OTG adapters, and external drives or USB sticks for moving installs or data.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/training_and_information_sessions/preparing_equipment_and_supplies_for_a_training/recommended_equipment_and_supplies.md]

## Notes

- For groups over five people, extra portable routers and power sources keep Exchange stable.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/training_and_information_sessions/preparing_equipment_and_supplies_for_a_training/recommended_equipment_and_supplies.md]
- Hotspots need a third phone; the hotspot device cannot sync while hosting the network.[Source: context/sources/mapeo_docs/complete_reference_guide/troubleshooting/solving_sync_issues/creating_local_wi_fi_networks/with_a_smartphone.md]
