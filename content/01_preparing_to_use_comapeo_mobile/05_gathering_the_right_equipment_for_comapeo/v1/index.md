# Gathering the Right Equipment for CoMapeo

![hero_image_optional](./images/placeholder_hero.txt)

## In this page you will learn

- How to choose a device that runs CoMapeo offline.
- What power, storage, and network gear to pack before fieldwork.

## Overview

Pick Android phones or tablets with enough power, storage, and protection to keep CoMapeo running offline. Bring chargers and routers or hotspots so Exchange works when there is no internet, and plan simple backup options for media and configs.

## Core concepts

- Android-only support — CoMapeo runs on Android 5.0+ devices; iOS is not supported.
- Space matters — keep at least 1 GB free so the app installs and can store data.
- Power and protection — charged batteries, portable chargers, and waterproof cases keep devices running in remote areas.
- Local networks — a portable router or spare phone hotspot lets teams Exchange without internet.

## Key flows

1. Confirm each device is Android 5.0+ with 1 GB free and virus-free.
2. Charge devices and pack power strips, USB hubs, and portable chargers for the team.
3. Add protection and storage: sturdy cases, SD card/USB storage, and waterproofing as needed.
4. Set up offline sharing: bring a TP-LINK-style portable router or plan a spare phone hotspot for Exchange.
5. Carry backup cables, OTG adapters, and external drives or USB sticks for moving installs or data.

## Notes

- For groups over five people, extra portable routers and power sources keep Exchange stable.
- Hotspots need a third phone; the hotspot device cannot sync while hosting the network.
