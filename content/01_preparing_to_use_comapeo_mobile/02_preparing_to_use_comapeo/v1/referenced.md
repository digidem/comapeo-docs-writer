- What you can do right after onboarding in My Solo Project and what remains limited until you join or create a project. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/multi_project/index.md]
- How to prepare a device and network so you can collaborate with teammates through a named project and Exchange. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/multi_project/index.md; context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]

## Overview

Prepare a device for CoMapeo by installing the app, allowing camera and location permissions, choosing whether to share metrics, and naming the device so teammates can recognize it. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md] After onboarding, CoMapeo opens in the Map view within My Solo Project, where you can explore features and capture observations on your own. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/multi_project/index.md] To collaborate, give My Solo Project a clear name or start a new project, connect devices on the same Wi-Fi or hotspot, and be ready to invite others and share data through Exchange. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/multi_project/index.md; context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]

## Core concepts

- First launch steps happen in order: welcome, permissions for camera and location, a metrics and privacy choice where you can opt in or out, and a required device name before you reach the Map view. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- The device name identifies you when others invite you and in project member lists, so choose something teammates will recognize. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- My Solo Project is the default state for new users; you can collect observations and adjust settings there, but exchanging data with others requires being on a named project. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/multi_project/index.md]
- Projects keep data consistent for a team: coordinators can import a .COMAPEOCAT category file so everyone shares the same categories after devices exchange or join. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]

## Key flows

1. Install CoMapeo from the Google Play Store or download the APK if the store is unavailable, then open the app. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
2. Allow camera and location permissions and tap Get Started on the welcome screen. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
3. Review the metrics prompt, opt in or out, and remember you can change this later in Settings > Data Privacy. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
4. Enter a device name, reach the Map view, and confirm you are in My Solo Project before collecting observations. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/multi_project/index.md]
5. Decide how to collaborate: rename My Solo Project or start a new project before team mapping, then connect devices to the same Wi-Fi or hotspot, invite them from Project settings, and import your category file so Exchange shares consistent data.

## Notes

- Without joining or creating a project you can still create and save observations, import configuration, share an individual observation, and adjust settings, but you cannot connect with other devices for Exchange. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- Coordinators invite devices that have CoMapeo open on the same network; the invite lets you assign Coordinator or Participant roles for the project. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Custom categories imported by a coordinator are shared with devices that join the project or exchange later, so import them early to keep data aligned. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
