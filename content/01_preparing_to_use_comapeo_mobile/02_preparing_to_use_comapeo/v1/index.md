## In this page you will learn

- How to install CoMapeo, grant permissions, and set up data privacy and device naming on first launch.
- What you can do right after onboarding in My Solo Project and what remains limited until you join or create a project.
- How to prepare a device and network so you can collaborate with teammates through a named project and Exchange.

## Overview

Prepare a device for CoMapeo by installing the app, allowing camera and location permissions, choosing whether to share metrics, and naming the device so teammates can recognize it. After onboarding, CoMapeo opens in the Map view within My Solo Project, where you can explore features and capture observations on your own. To collaborate, give My Solo Project a clear name or start a new project, connect devices on the same Wi-Fi or hotspot, and be ready to invite others and share data through Exchange.

## Core concepts

- First launch steps happen in order: welcome, permissions for camera and location, a metrics and privacy choice where you can opt in or out, and a required device name before you reach the Map view.
- The device name identifies you when others invite you and in project member lists, so choose something teammates will recognize.
- My Solo Project is the default state for new users; you can collect observations and adjust settings there, but exchanging data with others requires being on a named project.
- Projects keep data consistent for a team: coordinators can import a .COMAPEOCAT category file so everyone shares the same categories after devices exchange or join.

## Key flows

1. Install CoMapeo from the Google Play Store or download the APK if the store is unavailable, then open the app.
2. Allow camera and location permissions and tap Get Started on the welcome screen.
3. Review the metrics prompt, opt in or out, and remember you can change this later in Settings > Data Privacy.
4. Enter a device name, reach the Map view, and confirm you are in My Solo Project before collecting observations.
5. Decide how to collaborate: rename My Solo Project or start a new project before team mapping, then connect devices to the same Wi-Fi or hotspot, invite them from Project settings, and import your category file so Exchange shares consistent data.

## Notes

- Without joining or creating a project you can still create and save observations, import configuration, share an individual observation, and adjust settings, but you cannot connect with other devices for Exchange.
- Coordinators invite devices that have CoMapeo open on the same network; the invite lets you assign Coordinator or Participant roles for the project.
- Custom categories imported by a coordinator are shared with devices that join the project or exchange later, so import them early to keep data aligned.
