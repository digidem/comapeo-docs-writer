## In this page you will learn

- Finish onboarding so CoMapeo is ready to use.
- Start from the map view before joining a project.
- What actions are available before you join or create a project.
- Where to adjust CoMapeo settings for language, coordinates, and privacy.

## Overview

Complete the first launch screens, then start from the map view to explore basic tools. Before joining a project you can take observations and review settings, but you need a project to sync with others or keep data when you join later. Use the main menu to find project actions, app preferences, privacy controls, and security options.

## Core concepts

- Onboarding finishes after you accept or decline metrics sharing and name the device.
- CoMapeo opens on the map view; you begin without a project or role.
- In solo mode you can create observations and adjust preferences, but data does not sync and observations are removed when you join or create a project.
- The main menu (upper right) lists project actions, app settings, privacy, security, and About CoMapeo.

## Key flows

1. Complete onboarding
   - Tap Get Started on the welcome screen, review metrics, and choose to opt in or opt out; you can change this later in Data Privacy.
   - Enter a device name so others can identify you when inviting; confirm to open the map view.
2. Explore the map view on first use
   - CoMapeo opens to the map. From here you can start Exchange, check GPS accuracy, recenter your location, change the background map, view the scale bar, create an observation, switch between Map, Camera, and Observations, and open the main menu.
   - While not in a project you can create and save observations, import a configuration, adjust preferences, share individual observations, and open settings. You cannot sync with others, and any observations created before joining or creating a project will be removed once you join; create or join a project first if you need to keep data.
3. Adjust CoMapeo settings
   - Open the menu in the upper right. The entries are: Create or Join Project; Project Settings (Device Name, Your Team, Project Configuration); App Settings (Language, Coordinate system); Data & Privacy; Security (App Passcode); About CoMapeo.
