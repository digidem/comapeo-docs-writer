## In this page you will learn

- How to move through onboarding screens so CoMapeo has permissions, your privacy choice, and a device name. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- What to expect on the first Map view and the quick actions available there. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Why to join or create a project before collecting data and how to start if you plan to work with a team. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Overview

Start CoMapeo by granting camera and location access, choosing whether to share app metrics, and naming your device. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md] CoMapeo then opens to the Map view, where you can create observations, check GPS accuracy, and open Exchange. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md] If you plan to work with others, join or create a project before collecting so your observations stay with the team.

## Core concepts

- Onboarding requests camera and location permissions, and you choose to opt in or opt out of sharing metrics; you can change that choice later in Settings → Data Privacy.

- The device name identifies your phone when others invite you and appears in the team list. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- CoMapeo opens to the Map view after onboarding; from there you can start observations, open Exchange, check GPS accuracy, switch views, and open the main menu. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Observations created before joining or creating a project are removed when you later join; staying outside a project also prevents syncing with others. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Key flows

1. Open CoMapeo and tap Get Started; allow camera and location when prompted. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
2. Choose to opt in or opt out of metrics; adjust the choice anytime in Settings → Data Privacy. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md] [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
3. Enter a device name, then continue to the Map view. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
4. On the Map view, check GPS accuracy, recenter if needed, switch between map, camera, and observations list, start a new observation with the orange + button, or open Exchange and the main menu. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
5. If you will collaborate, create or join a project before collecting. Connect devices to the same Wi‑Fi, then invite teammates from Project Settings → Your Team while CoMapeo is open on their devices. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Notes

- Starting a project early prevents losing observations made before joining. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- Keep CoMapeo open on all devices during invites and Exchange. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
