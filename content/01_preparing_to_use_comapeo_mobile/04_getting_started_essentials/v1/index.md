# Getting Started - Essentials

![Welcome to CoMapeo](./images/screenshot_2024_09_05_at_10_39_03_am.png)

## In this page you will learn

- How to move through onboarding screens so CoMapeo has permissions, your privacy choice, and a device name.
- What to expect on the first Map view and the quick actions available there.
- Why to join or create a project before collecting data and how to start if you plan to work with a team.

## Overview

Start CoMapeo by granting camera and location access, choosing whether to share app metrics, and naming your device. CoMapeo then opens to the Map view, where you can create observations, check GPS accuracy, and open Exchange. If you plan to work with others, join or create a project before collecting so your observations stay with the team.

## Core concepts

- Onboarding requests camera and location permissions, and you choose to opt in or opt out of sharing metrics; you can change that choice later in Settings → Data Privacy.
- The device name identifies your phone when others invite you and appears in the team list.
- CoMapeo opens to the Map view after onboarding; from there you can start observations, open Exchange, check GPS accuracy, switch views, and open the main menu.
- Observations created before joining or creating a project are removed when you later join; staying outside a project also prevents syncing with others.

## Key flows

1. Open CoMapeo and tap Get Started; allow camera and location when prompted.
2. Choose to opt in or opt out of metrics; adjust the choice anytime in Settings → Data Privacy.
3. Enter a device name, then continue to the Map view.
4. On the Map view, check GPS accuracy, recenter if needed, switch between map, camera, and observations list, start a new observation with the orange + button, or open Exchange and the main menu.
5. If you will collaborate, create or join a project before collecting. Connect devices to the same Wi‑Fi, then invite teammates from Project Settings → Your Team while CoMapeo is open on their devices.

## Notes

- Starting a project early prevents losing observations made before joining.
- Keep CoMapeo open on all devices during invites and Exchange.
