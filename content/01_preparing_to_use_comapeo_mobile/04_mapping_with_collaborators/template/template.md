# Creating Custom Category Sets

**Reasons for customizing CoMapeo Category Sets**
-   Custom Categories are a powerful tool for customization in CoMapeo,
    allowing users to define specific icons, and questionnaires for
    their projects.
-   Text can be written in any language that can be typed, ensuring that
    key parts of the data collection interface can appear in the native
    language of the groups using it.
**Reflect and organize information you will need**
Initial planning and consultation with project participants is essential
to designing effective ways of organizing your data. To start the
customization process, project participants should reflect on the
project goals, what kind of data will be needed, and what properties
might be required for data outputs.
You will need to think through what to include for each of the **key
customizable areas of CoMapeo.**
-   **(https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/customization-options/custom-configurations/creating-custom-configurations/planning-configuration-and-data-structure/categories).**
    When collecting or creating data with CoMapeo, users assign a
    top-level category to each observation or element on the map.
-   **(https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/customization-options/custom-configurations/creating-custom-configurations/planning-configuration-and-data-structure/icons).**
    Each Category you include must have an icon or a small graphic to
    display to users when selecting a category.
-   [**[Details
    fields.]**](https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/customization-options/custom-configurations/creating-custom-configurations/planning-configuration-and-data-structure/details-fields)
    For each Category in your Category Set, you can include one or more
    structured data fields (like a mini form or questionnaire) that
    users can optionally fill out when creating a new observation or map
    element with that category.
Once you have this information, use the **CoMapeo Category Generator
Spreadsheet** to create your categories. This tool will allow you to
create and edit Categories, icons, details fields and language, and
export all this information into a **.comapeocat** file, which you will
import to your phone (and share among participants if you are on the
same project) to start documenting and exchanging information.
**If you already have a Mapeo
*configuration* file, and want to work
from there to create your CoMapeo
Category Set, start in Step 1. If you
are creating your CoMapeo Category Set
from scratch, start with Step 7.**
1.  Download Mapeo config file (ending
in .mapeosettings)into the computer
that you will use to customize your
CoMapeo Category Set.
> If you have it in a zip file, make
> sure you unzip it first and extract
> your file to have it available as
> .mapeosettings file where you can
> easily find it.

![](./images/image69.png) — the copy you make of the template
has **"CoMapeo Tools" on the right
of the top menu**. This means this
spreadsheet has the script that
will generate your .comapeocat
file.
-   If you want access to previous
iterations of your category file,
create a copy for each iteration,
rather than just editing their
version, and update the name and
date fo the copy.

can also add a thematic color that will

**Color of the icon** (COLUMN D)
14. When you create an icon using the
**CoMapeo Icon Generator, you will
find a color code below your svg
file options** (see example
#1F8C55)**.** This code indicates
the color you have chosen in the
color grid. Documenting this code
is useful if you want to use it
again in the future for this or
other icons, in this or other
design tools. On Column D you can
keep record of this color code.

**type** of response you want to
get as detail:
-   **Text** for written responses
-   **Multiple** for a list of options
-   **Number** for numerical responses
17. To write the list of multiple
options for a response, write them
within the same cell under the
Column D. Write a comma after each
option to indicate these are
separate options.

png) — that there are no commas in the labels,
especially if you have phrases longer
than 1 or 2 words. Commas indicate to
the spreadsheet the end of a label and
the beginning of the next one, so
having commas in a phrase will split it
into different labels.
-Go to the **"Categories"** tab and
check that the labels in the "Labels"
column are correct. If you find any
mistakes, go to the "Detail" tab and
correct the text there. Refresh the
spreadsheet.
If there are errors (such as commas)
you will see a red corner on the left
side of the cells under the "Detail"
columns. You can always go back to the
"Details" tab and fix typos, mistakes,
and refresh the spreadsheet.
