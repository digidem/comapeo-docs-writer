## Overview

CoMapeo is a collaboration tool for Indigenous territory monitoring and mapping, designed so communities manage mapping data and observations without depending on internet connectivity. [Source: context/sources/mega_deck/brand_and_narrative_assets.md] It combines a mobile app, desktop app, and decentralized database to keep projects private and under community control.

## Core concepts

- Projects are private, encrypted mapping spaces where coordinators define the categories and invite devices so everyone gathers consistent data. [Source: context/sources/mega_deck/brand_and_narrative_assets.md]
- CoMapeo keeps observations on each device and shares them peer to peer, letting teams map together even on a local Wi-Fi router or hotspot. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Roles clarify responsibilities: Coordinators manage project settings and invites, while Participants focus on collecting and sharing observations. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Key flows

1. Install CoMapeo from the Google Play Store, or download the APK when the store is not available. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
2. On first launch, grant camera and location permissions, choose whether to share metrics in Data Privacy, and name the device so teammates can recognize it. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
3. After onboarding, CoMapeo opens to the Map view. You can explore and create observations before joining a project if you are mapping solo. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
4. When mapping with a team, create or join a project before collecting data so observations stay with the project and can sync across devices. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
5. Coordinators invite devices on the same Wi-Fi network and assign Coordinator or Participant roles to shape who manages settings and who collects data. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Notes

- Observations created before joining or creating a project are lost when you later join a project, and devices cannot exchange data until they share a project. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- Without a project you can still create and save observations, adjust preferences, share a single observation from the device menu, and open settings such as Security, Language, and Coordinates. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
