## Overview

CoMapeo is a digital mapping app for territory monitors that keeps projects private and under community control without depending on internet connectivity. [Source: context/sources/mega_deck/brand_and_narrative_assets.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md] It combines a mobile app, desktop app, and decentralized database so teams can record GPS points with photos or audio and share them securely when they are on the same project.

## Core concepts

- Projects keep data consistent and secure by storing the name, verified devices, and category set used for observations; create or join a project before team mapping so observations stay with that project. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- Exchange shares observations between devices on the same project when they are on the same Wi-Fi router or hotspot, allowing teams to sync offline. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- Roles define collaboration: Coordinators manage project details, categories, and invites; Participants collect and share observations but cannot change project settings. When you first open CoMapeo, the device has no role until you create or join a project.

## Key flows

1. Install CoMapeo from the Google Play Store; if Play Store access is unavailable, download the APK and install it directly. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
2. Open CoMapeo, allow camera and location permissions, and tap Get Started. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
3. Review the metrics and privacy prompt, choose to opt in or opt out, and change the choice later in Settings > Data Privacy. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
4. Enter a device name so teammates can recognize it, then continue to the Map view to start exploring. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
5. Set up collaboration: create or join a project before collecting team data, import your category file if needed, then invite devices on the same Wi-Fi network and assign Coordinator or Participant roles so everyone can exchange observations.

## Notes

- Observations created before joining or creating a project are lost once you join a project later. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- Devices not on a project cannot exchange data; while mapping solo you can create and save observations, import configuration, adjust preferences, share an individual observation via the device menu, and use settings like Security, Language, and Coordinates. [Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
- Invited devices need to be on the same Wi-Fi network with CoMapeo open to appear for Exchange and project invites. [Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
