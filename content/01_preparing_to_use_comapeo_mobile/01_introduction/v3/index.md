## In this page you will learn

- How CoMapeo supports offline, community-led mapping with private projects.
- What to expect on first launch, from permissions to data privacy choices and device naming.
- How projects, roles, and Exchange set up collaboration on the same network.

## Overview

CoMapeo is a digital mapping app for territory monitors that keeps projects private and under community control without depending on internet connectivity. It combines a mobile app, desktop app, and decentralized database so teams can record GPS points with photos or audio and share them securely when they are on the same project.

## Core concepts

- Projects keep data consistent and secure by storing the name, verified devices, and category set used for observations; create or join a project before team mapping so observations stay with that project.
- Exchange shares observations between devices on the same project when they are on the same Wi-Fi router or hotspot, allowing teams to sync offline.
- Roles define collaboration: Coordinators manage project details, categories, and invites; Participants collect and share observations but cannot change project settings. When you first open CoMapeo, the device has no role until you create or join a project.

## Key flows

1. Install CoMapeo from the Google Play Store; if Play Store access is unavailable, download the APK and install it directly.
2. Open CoMapeo, allow camera and location permissions, and tap Get Started.
3. Review the metrics and privacy prompt, choose to opt in or opt out, and change the choice later in Settings > Data Privacy.
4. Enter a device name so teammates can recognize it, then continue to the Map view to start exploring.
5. Set up collaboration: create or join a project before collecting team data, import your category file if needed, then invite devices on the same Wi-Fi network and assign Coordinator or Participant roles so everyone can exchange observations.

## Notes

- Observations created before joining or creating a project are lost once you join a project later.
- Devices not on a project cannot exchange data; while mapping solo you can create and save observations, import configuration, adjust preferences, share an individual observation via the device menu, and use settings like Security, Language, and Coordinates.
- Invited devices need to be on the same Wi-Fi network with CoMapeo open to appear for Exchange and project invites.
