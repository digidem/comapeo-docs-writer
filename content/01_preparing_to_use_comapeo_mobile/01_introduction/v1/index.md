## In this page you will learn

- What CoMapeo is and how it supports offline, community-led mapping.
- What to expect on first launch before joining a project.
- How projects and roles shape collaboration.

## Overview

CoMapeo is a collaboration tool for Indigenous territory monitoring and mapping, designed so communities manage mapping data and observations without depending on internet connectivity. It combines a mobile app, desktop app, and decentralized database to keep projects private and under community control.

## Core concepts

- Projects are private, encrypted mapping spaces where coordinators define the categories and invite devices so everyone gathers consistent data.
- CoMapeo keeps observations on each device and shares them peer to peer, letting teams map together even on a local Wi-Fi router or hotspot.
- Roles clarify responsibilities: Coordinators manage project settings and invites, while Participants focus on collecting and sharing observations.

## Key flows

1. Install CoMapeo from the Google Play Store, or download the APK when the store is not available.
2. On first launch, grant camera and location permissions, choose whether to share metrics in Data Privacy, and name the device so teammates can recognize it.
3. After onboarding, CoMapeo opens to the Map view. You can explore and create observations before joining a project if you are mapping solo.
4. When mapping with a team, create or join a project before collecting data so observations stay with the project and can sync across devices.
5. Coordinators invite devices on the same Wi-Fi network and assign Coordinator or Participant roles to shape who manages settings and who collects data.

## Notes

- Observations created before joining or creating a project are lost when you later join a project, and devices cannot exchange data until they share a project.
- Without a project you can still create and save observations, adjust preferences, share a single observation from the device menu, and open settings such as Security, Language, and Coordinates.
