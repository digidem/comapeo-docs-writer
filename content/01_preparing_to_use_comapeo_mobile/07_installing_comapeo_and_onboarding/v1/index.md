## In this page you will learn

- How to install CoMapeo Mobile on Android when Play Store access is available or limited.
- What to expect during onboarding, including permissions and data privacy choices.
- How device naming works and what happens right after onboarding.

## Overview

Install CoMapeo Mobile from the Google Play Store when possible, or use the APK only when Play Store access is unavailable. On first launch, onboarding requests camera and location permissions, lets you opt in or out of sharing diagnostics, and requires a device name so teammates can identify you. After onboarding, CoMapeo opens in the Map view ready for you to explore or start setting up a project.

## Core concepts

- Play Store install is the default; the APK is the fallback when you cannot use the store.
- Onboarding asks for camera and location access so you can capture observations with GPS.
- You can opt in or out of sharing diagnostics during onboarding and change it later in Settings → Data Privacy.
- Every device needs a name, which other project members will see when inviting or collaborating.

## Key flows

1. Open Google Play Store, search for CoMapeo, and install; use the APK only if you cannot access the store.
2. Launch CoMapeo, allow camera and location access, and choose whether to share diagnostics.
3. Enter a device name, finish onboarding, and start from the Map view; create or join a project before team mapping.

## Notes

- You can open CoMapeo directly from the Play Store after installation, but it will also appear in your app list.
- If you plan to map with others, complete onboarding, then create or join a project before collecting shared data.
