- How to install CoMapeo Mobile on Android when Play Store access is available or limited.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- What to expect during onboarding, including permissions and data privacy choices.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- How device naming works and what happens right after onboarding.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Overview

Install CoMapeo Mobile from the Google Play Store when possible, or use the APK only when Play Store access is unavailable.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md] On first launch, onboarding requests camera and location permissions, lets you opt in or out of sharing diagnostics, and requires a device name so teammates can identify you.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md] After onboarding, CoMapeo opens in the Map view ready for you to explore or start setting up a project.[Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Core concepts

- Play Store install is the default; the APK is the fallback when you cannot use the store.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Onboarding asks for camera and location access so you can capture observations with GPS.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- You can opt in or out of sharing diagnostics during onboarding and change it later in Settings → Data Privacy.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- Every device needs a name, which other project members will see when inviting or collaborating.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Key flows

1. Open Google Play Store, search for CoMapeo, and install; use the APK only if you cannot access the store.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
2. Launch CoMapeo, allow camera and location access, and choose whether to share diagnostics.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
3. Enter a device name, finish onboarding, and start from the Map view; create or join a project before team mapping.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md; context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]

## Notes

- You can open CoMapeo directly from the Play Store after installation, but it will also appear in your app list.[Source: context/sources/setup_guide/setup_guide.md]
- If you plan to map with others, complete onboarding, then create or join a project before collecting shared data.[Source: context/sources/quickstart_guides/mvp_mobile_quick_start/index.md]
