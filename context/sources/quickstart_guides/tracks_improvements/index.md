### Background

[Tracks MVP](https://www.notion.so/Record-tracks-MVP-c1b4ec2a48974e12ba84aa36c6ddba5c?pvs=21) was released in CoMapeo early 2025. Since then, we have been gathering feedback from the Awana Digital team and our partners during field trainings. 

### What‚Äôs New

Improvements address the following feedback:

- Unclear copy of the steps to follow to record a track
- The saving a track flow is confusing
- Categories are missing
- The track line on the map could be improved

### Details

- **Sharing** - Currently, a Track cannot be shared because of the many Observations attached to it, causing too much media to be shared at one time. CoDesign will meet with App Dev to discuss our options.
- **Background Location Permission** - For the feature to work, CoMapeo will be asking for background location permission, which means Tracks will be active even when the app is closed. To stop from tracking, you can click on Stop Track to stop the feature, or stop sharing their location via the device‚Äôs Settings
