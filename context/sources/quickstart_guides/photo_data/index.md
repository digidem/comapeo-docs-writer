### Background

CoMapeo has been gathering both Observation GPS and Photo Metadata but it was not being displayed.

### What‚Äôs New

We are introducing Photo Info which allows users to view and share an individual photo‚Äôs metadata, in case it‚Äôs being challenged for their authenticity.

1. Go to any Observation with photos 
2. Tap on a photo thumbnail
3. The new Photo Info screen will appear. It displays the following details about the photo:
    - **Validated by CoMapeo**

### Upcoming Improvement

In an upcoming CoMapeo update, the ‚ÄúValidated by CoMapeo‚Äù header will become a module that describes important details about a photo‚Äôs authenticity.

Whenever tapped, the Validated by CoMapeo module expands to displays key metrics about the photo‚Äôs integrity.

This includes:

- amount of time the photo was attached after the observation was created;
- the distance from the original location of observation creation; and
- the device from where the photo originated.

When tapped again, the Validated by CoMapeo module collapses to its original state.
