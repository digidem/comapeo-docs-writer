# Multi Projects

![Screenshot 2025-06-09 at 2.13.02‚ÄØPM.png](./images/screenshot_2025_06_09_at_2_13_02_pm.png)

### Background

CoMapeo v3 could only support one project at a time. 

When a user launched the app for the first time, they were automatically mapping on their own. If they needed to map with others, they needed to name their solo project before being able to invite other devices to that project. That being said, any data collected when mapping on their own was kept in tact. 

However, if a user accepted an invitation to another project‚Äîwhether mapping on their own or from another project‚Äîthey were forced to leave the current project *and* lose any data collected before being able to join the new project. This was an unsustainable experience for our users.

### What‚Äôs New

CoMapeo v5 introduces Multiple Projects, which supports many projects existing at once while also protecting all observations gathered across projects on a device. A user can map on their own, be on another project, receive an invite and join new projects all without having to leave their current project or losing any data.

<aside>

### Multiple Feature x CoMapeo Roles

At any time, a person using CoMapeo experiences it as one of three roles:

- **Mapping On Your Own**
    
    When first using CoMapeo, users begin with an individual mapping experience called 'My Solo Project.' Any observations collected during this initial 'Mapping On Your Own' phase cannot be shared with other users. To exchange Observations with collaborators, users must rename 'My Solo Project' to a custom project name.
    
- **Coordinator**
    
    When a user renames 'My Solo Project' to any custom name, they are automatically designated the Coordinator role for that project. As a Coordinator, a user can invite collaborators to join their project.
    
    A user can also become a Coordinator if;
    
    - they create a new project by tapping on  ‚ÄòAll Projects‚Äô then ‚ÄòStart New Project‚Äô
    - they receive and accept a Project Invite to be a Coordinator from an existing Coordinator of a project.
- **Participant**
    
    Users may also receive Project Invites from Coordinators to join projects as Participants. When accepting this invitation, the user becomes a Participant of that specific project.

### Collaborating with Other Devices

When mapping on your own, there are **two** ways to start collaborating with other devices using CoMapeo.

When mapping on your own, your first project is simply ‚ÄúMy Solo Project‚Äù. You can gather an unlimited amount of observations to this project.

If you‚Äôd like to share observations from ‚ÄúMy Solo Project‚Äù using CoMapeo‚Äôs Exchange feature, then you will need to give ‚ÄúMy Solo Project‚Äù a new name. 

Once successfully renamed, the project is ready to invite devices and use the Exchange feature.
