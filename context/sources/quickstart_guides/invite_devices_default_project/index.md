# üèÅ CoMapeo Mobile - Invite devices to default project

Last Edited: September 3, 2025 5:33 PM
Guide Status: Ready to read

<aside>
üìå **Important to note -  This is a temporary workflow in V3, until adding Multi-projects in the next release (v4), early June. Expect a few more updates to the UI.** 

CoMapeo V3 can only support one project at a time. 

When mapping on its own, the device is adding collected observations to the default project (also known as ‚ÄúMy Solo Project‚Äù). 

Any time a device want to join a new project from their ‚ÄúMy Solo Project‚Äù, then CoMapeo will require for all collected observations to be deleted first. To preserve any collected observations in a default project, Awana Digital recommends sharing each observation to an email using the Share feature on each observation.

Any time a device want to join a new project from another project (whether it be the default or custom named project), then CoMapeo will require the device to **leave the project first**. This step reverts the device back to ‚ÄúMy Solo Project‚Äù, the default project, and will also require for all collected observations on the device to be deleted in order to do so.

On CoMapeo v2, you can launch the app for the first time and create observations. However, if you want to map with others, and exchange data, you have to create a project and consequently lose all the data you had previously collected. 

This update allows you to launch the app for the first time, collect observations, and when you are ready to map with others, simply name the project. Once the project is named, you can see the observations already collected, invite collaborators and exchange data.

### CoMapeo Roles

At any time, a person using CoMapeo experiences it as one of three roles:

- **Mapping On Your Own**
    
    When first using CoMapeo, users begin with an individual mapping experience called 'My Solo Project.' Any observations collected during this initial 'Mapping On Your Own' phase cannot be shared with other users. To exchange Observations with collaborators, users must rename 'My Solo Project' to a custom project name.
    
- **Coordinator**
    
    When a user renames 'My Solo Project' to any custom name, they are automatically designated the Coordinator role for that project. As a Coordinator, a user can invite collaborators to join their project.
    
    A user can also become a Coordinator if they receive and accept a Project Invite to be a Coordinator from an existing Coordinator of a project.
    
- **Participant**
    
    Users may also receive Project Invites from Coordinators to join projects as Participants. When accepting this invitation, the user becomes a Participant of that specific project.

### **I am mapping on my own. How does it work?**

1. Once you have gone through the onboarding steps, you will land on the map view and see at the top of the app the default header displaying ‚ÄúMy Solo Project‚Äù, this means you are mapping on your own.
2. When mapping on your own, you can collect, edit and delete observations, import custom categories, add a custom map, and use most features that don‚Äôt involve sharing data.
