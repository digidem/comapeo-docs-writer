**How do I stop and save Tracks?**

**How do I view my Track?**

</aside>

<aside>

**Details :**

- **Observation Detail View** -  When clicking on an observation, you will be able to view the track it was part of.
- **Track Detail View** - When clicking on a Track, you will be able to see all the observations created while the feature was active.
- **Sharing** - Currently, a Track cannot be shared because of the many Observations attached to it, causing too much media to be shared at one time. CoDesign will meet with App Dev to discuss our options.
- **Background Location Permission** - For the feature to work, CoMapeo will be asking for background location permission, which means Tracks will be active even when the app is closed. To stop from tracking, you can click on Stop Track to stop the feature, or stop sharing their location via the device‚Äôs Settings.
- **Saving a Track -** In order to be able to save a Track, you need to have moved a certain distance on the map.
    - For example, if you tap on [Start Tracks], do not move, didn‚Äôt collect Observations, and click [Stop Tracks] - the bottom sheet will close.

# What‚Äôs new? What‚Äôs missing?

## Background Maps

CoMapeo¬†Mobile now supports [style-map-packages](https://github.com/digidem/styled-map-package) only. The app dev team is working on a tool that could help you convert **mbtiles** files to our new **SMP** format. 

## Configs

Update : the extension of the created configuration needs to be `.comapeocat`

[Path to updating configs for CoMapeo](https://www.notion.so/Path-to-updating-configs-for-CoMapeo-614733e4acb740a4a15944ba2ac8b304?pvs=21) 

## Missing items that existed in Mapeo

- Settings / Experiments / Obscure Passcode
    - This feature will be re-implemented to CoMapeo before the end of 2024.
- Settings / Map Settings / Map Manager
    - The introduction of the map file picker allowed us to delay development on the Map Manager. We will discuss when to develop this feature early 2025.
