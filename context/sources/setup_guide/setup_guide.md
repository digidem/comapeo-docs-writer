Categories in CoMapeo \(previously called configuration in Mapeo\) are how information gathered is identified and organized\. Each Category has a label and icon\.

CoMapeo includes a set of default categories\. You can also create your own set of categories specifically for project needs\, and there are some companion tools for CoMapeo to support these\.

When customized categories are imported by a coordinator onto a project\, they are subsequently shared with all devices that they do a  __CoMapeo exchange__  with\, so data can be viewed equally\.

If you are a Project Coordinator you can add your bespoke category file\, to then sync with the team\.

Ensure you have the categories file downloaded onto this device \(file format \.COMAPEOCAT\)

Tap  __Import Config__

Choose the file\, its name should then appear under the categories/configuration inplace of the default\.

The categories are shared with other devices when others are invited/accept invitation to a project\, or when data is exchanged\.

Make sure that all the devices are on the same wifi network \- this does not need to be an internet connected network\, a local network is fine\, such as a phone hotspot\.
