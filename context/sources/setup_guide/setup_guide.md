# CoMapeo Setup Guide (Projects and Teams)

This guide helps you install CoMapeo, prepare a device, and set up a project and team so you can start mapping together.

## Download CoMapeo
- Get CoMapeo from the Google Play Store.
- If Play Store access is unavailable, download the APK and install it directly.

![Welcome](images/setup_guide_2.png)

## First Launch and Permissions
- On first launch, CoMapeo requests permissions it needs to function:
  - Camera (take photos)
  - Location (record observations)
- After permissions, you will see a Welcome screen. Tap “Get Started”.

## Metrics and Data Privacy
- CoMapeo presents metrics it collects; you can opt in or opt out.
- You can change this later in Settings → Data Privacy.

![Metrics and privacy options](images/setup_guide_9.png)

## Device Naming
- Enter a device name. Other devices see this when inviting you to a project, and it appears in the list of project members.
- After naming the device, tap “Go to Map”.

![Device naming](images/setup_guide_12.png)

## Map Overview
On the Map view you can:
- Open Exchange (share with devices on the same project)
- Check GPS accuracy (in meters)
- Recenter your location
- Change background map
- See the scale bar
- Create an observation (orange button)
- Switch between Map, Camera, and Observations list
- Open the main menu

## Projects
A project keeps data consistent and secure across a team. Project settings may include the project name, verified devices, and categories.

### Create a Project
- Open the main menu → Project → Create
- Name the project

### Categories (Configuration)
- Categories in CoMapeo identify and organize what you collect; each category has a label and an icon.
- CoMapeo includes default categories. Coordinators can import a custom category file (`.COMAPEOCAT`) tailored to project needs.
- When a Coordinator imports a category file, it is shared with devices that join the project or exchange data.

### Project Roles
- Coordinator: invite devices; manage project details and users; edit and delete data as needed.
- Participant: create and share observations within a project; cannot manage project settings or users.

### Add Team Members
- Install CoMapeo and name each device.
- Connect devices to the same Wi‑Fi network (internet not required; a local hotspot is fine).
- On a Coordinator device: Project Settings → Your Team → Invite Device.
- Other devices on the same network appear; invite them as Coordinators or Participants.
- Invited devices receive an on‑screen invitation (CoMapeo must be open) and can accept to join the project.

## Offline Map (Optional)
- If working offline, add a custom background map to each device.
- Steps: Settings → Map Management → Background Map → choose your downloaded map (e.g., `.smp`).
- After selection, CoMapeo confirms and the map appears in the Map view.

## Collecting Data
- From Map or Camera, tap the orange “+” button to create an observation, then pick a category.

## Observation Details
- Add a short description.
- Answer category‑specific detail fields (if present).
- Add photos.
- Optionally record audio.
- Save the observation.

## Observations List and Editing
- The Observations list shows your device’s observations and those exchanged from teammates.
- Participants can edit observations collected on their own device.
- Coordinators can edit all observations.
- For data integrity, GPS coordinates and the timestamp of a saved observation cannot be edited.

## Audio Recording
- Add an audio recording when creating an observation to include context and testimony.
- Maximum length per recording: 5 minutes (recording saved as an `.mp4`).

## Exchanging Data
- Data exchanges work between devices on the same project. Use Exchange when connected to the same local network or per your project’s setup.

<span style="color:#ffffff">Categories</span>

Categories in CoMapeo \(previously called configuration in Mapeo\) are how information gathered is identified and organized\. Each Category has a label and icon\.

CoMapeo includes a set of default categories\. You can also create your own set of categories specifically for project needs\, and there are some companion tools for CoMapeo to support these\.

When customized categories are imported by a coordinator onto a project\, they are subsequently shared with all devices that they do a  __CoMapeo exchange__  with\, so data can be viewed equally\.

Data exchange happens in both directions\, so Mobile A will get Mobile B’s data and vice versa\.

To exchange data devices have to be on the same network \- it could be a wifi network with internet\, or it could be a local network \- eg\. phone hotspot \- without an internet connection\.
