## Slide 1 — Setting up CoMapeo for Projects and Teams

## Slide 2 — Getting Started • Download CoMapeo
- Download CoMapeo from the Google Playstore.
- If you don’t have access to the Playstore an .apk is also available for download and direct installation.

## Slide 3 — Getting Started • Welcome
- When launching CoMapeo the first time, you will be asked for access to some permissions.
- It will ask for access to camera to take photos
- And location to take observations

## Slide 4 — Getting Started • Welcome
- Then you will see a Welcome screen.
- This screen highlights the benefits of using CoMapeo.
- To proceed, tap on “Get Started”

## Slide 5 — Getting Started • Metrics & Privacy Policy
- The app will present the metrics it collects.
- You can choose to “opt in” or “opt out” which can be changed later via “Settings > Data Privacy.”
- See Our Privacy Policy in English:CoMapeo Data & Privacy

## Slide 6 — Getting Started • Device Naming
- You must enter a name for the device.
- Can you change your name? What if two people have the same name on a project?
- This is the name other devices will see when inviting you to project.
- It will also display in the list of project members.
- Once you have added a name you can ‘Go to Map’ and start mapping!

## Slide 7 — Getting Started • Overview
- Welcome
- Data & Privacy Policy
- Device Naming

## Slide 8 — Using CoMapeo • First-time Use
- After getting started, CoMapeo will always start in the Map view where you may begin exploring its features.
- If you intend to map on your own, and not collect data for a project, go ahead and start using CoMapeo.
- If you intend to gather observations with a team, then either create a project, or join an existing one first, before creating any observations.

## Slide 9 — Getting Started • Open to map view
- Exchange (previously Sync)
- Shows GPS accuracy in meters. Tap this button for more GPS information.
- Recenter your location
- Background map
- Scale Bar
- Tap to create observation
- Your current location
- List of Observations -- Map View -- Camera View -- Collect Tracks
- Main menu - tap to expand

## Slide 10 — Grow Your Team • Create a Project
- About setting up a Project
- A project is a container within CoMapeo that stores shareable project settings to keep data secure and consistent across a team.
- Project settings can include project name, verified devices, and categories.
- Project Name: a short and specific name will help keep data gathering activities focused.
- Current Limitations
- Any observations taken before you are on a project will not be saved when you join or create a project later. All your observations will be deleted when you join a project.
- When not on a project you cannot connect with other devices and sync.

## Slide 11 — Projects • Create a Project
- Create a project
- Go to the main menu to see Project Options, select Project
- Give your project a name
- Then, if you are going to use your own bespoke categories (config), now is the best time to add them, before adding any participants to the project.

## Slide 12 — Projects • Categories
- Categories
- Categories in CoMapeo (previously called configuration in Mapeo) are how information gathered is identified and organized. Each Category has a label and icon.
- CoMapeo includes a set of default categories. You can also create your own set of categories specifically for project needs, and there are some companion tools for CoMapeo to support these.
- When customized categories are imported by a coordinator onto a project, they are subsequently shared with all devices that they do a CoMapeo exchange with, so data can be viewed equally.

## Slide 13 — Projects • Categories
- Import categories
- From the top right hand menu choose Project Settings -- Categories (or Configuration). You will see the name of the categories on your CoMapeo.
- If you are a Project Coordinator you can add your bespoke category file, to then sync with the team.
- Ensure you have the categories file downloaded onto this device (file format .COMAPEOCAT)
- Tap Import Config
- Choose the file, its name should then appear under the categories/configuration inplace of the default.
- The categories are shared with other devices when others are invited/accept invitation to a project, or when data is exchanged.

## Slide 14 — Grow Your Team • Project Roles
- Project Roles
- CoMapeo has two roles available for teams: Project Coordinator and Project Participant.
- When you first open and use the app your device does not have a role, but your device can be invited to a project as a Participant or a Coordinator. It is important to consider the security needed for a project on CoMapeo when selecting device roles.
- If you create a project, then your device is automatically set up as a Coordinator for that project.
- Coordinators can invite devices to a project, edit and delete data, and manage project details.
- Participants can take and share observations. They can not manage users or project details.

## Slide 15 — Grow Your Team • Coordinator Role
- Coordinators can:
- Take and share observations
- Edit observations created by others
- Invite devices to projects as either Coordinators or Participants
- Manage project details
- Import configurations (Categories)
- Leave project
- Coordinators have greater control over project setup and permissions.
- The device that creates a project becomes a Project Coordinator.
- Other devices can be invited as Coordinators to the project when invited by an existing Project Coordinator.
- Project Coordinators should be trusted devices as they are in charge of managing project details and inviting devices to a project.

## Slide 16 — Grow Your Team • Participant Role
- Participants can:
- Take and share observations
- Edit observations they created
- View project data
- Leave project
- Participants cannot:
- Edit observations created by others
- Invite other devices to the project
- Import config (categories)
- Edit project details (e.g. project name)
- Participants contribute and share observations within a project.
- A Project Participant is any device that has joined the Project.
- They can create, sync, and share observations but cannot manage the project’s settings or users.

## Slide 17 — Projects • Add team
- Add team members
- Choose which of your devices are going to be set up as participants and which as coordinators.
- Install CoMapeo on all of the other devices, as in the instructions above and give each device a name.
- Make sure that all the devices are on the same wifi network - this does not need to be an internet connected network, a local network is fine, such as a phone hotspot.
- The image to the Right shows the current device as Coordinator on the project, no more team added yet.

## Slide 18 — Projects • Add team
- Add team members
- On your original Coordinator device go to Project Settings -- Your Team -- Invite Device
- The name of any other devices connected to the network should appear, and you can choose to invite them as a coordinator or a participant.

## Slide 19 — Projects • Add Team
- Add team members - continued
- The other device you have chosen should then get an invitation on their screen - they need to have CoMapeo open - and they can choose to accept (or decline) the invitation.
- If they accept the invitation they get a success screen.
- They will have the same categories file as the coordinator.

## Slide 20 — Using CoMapeo • Offline Map
- Adding a Custom Offline Map
- CoMapeo contains an online default map, but if you are offline you will only see a map if you add your own custom offline map.
- The custom map does not synchronize across devices in a project, you have to manually add it to each device.
- Start by downloading your custom map to the phone downloads folder.

## Slide 21 — Using CoMapeo • Offline Map
- Adding a Custom Offline Map
- In CoMapeo go to App Settings (top right hand corner menu).
- Then: Map Management -- Background Map
- Navigate to the right downloaded map, it should be a .smp file
- Choose the map, and it should be added, you will get a confirmation screen in CoMapeo
- You will see the custom map now on your map screen in CoMapeo.

## Slide 22 — Getting Started • Open to map view
- Now your team is ready to start collecting data!

## Slide 23 — Getting Started • Collecting data
- Map screen
- Camera screen
- List of categories
- Save an observation by clicking the orange button on the map OR camera screen, then pick a category

## Slide 24 — Using CoMapeo • First-time Use
- Adding information to observations
- Once you choose a category, you will be taken to a screen where you can add extra information to the observation.
- You can add a short note or description
- If there are further detailed questions set up for your categories you can answer these.
- You can also add photographs.
- And you can add audio recordings if you wish.
- Finally save your observation.

## Slide 25 — Using CoMapeo • First-time Use
- List of observations
- All your collected observations, and any observations you have collected through exchanging with others can be seen in the observation list.
- Participants can only edit the observations collected on their own device. All others will appear with a blue line by the side.
- Coordinator devices can edit all observations.

## Slide 26 — Using CoMapeo • First-time Use
- Editing observations
- After an observation has been saved some of the information can be edited.
- The observation category and details fields can be edited. To ensure data integrity, GPS coordinates, time and date of collected observation can NOT be edited by anyone.
- Participants can only edit the observations collected on their own device.
- Coordinator devices can edit all observations.

## Slide 27 — Getting Started • Collecting data
- Details - questionnaire
- Collect audio recordings
- Add audio, photos or more details on the observation screen.

## Slide 28 — Using CoMapeo • First-time Use
- Audio recording
- Adding the audio recording allows Earth Defenders to add their own voice and testimonies to the data they gather, to capture the full extent of environmental harm that cannot be captured in a single photo.
- The audio recording feature can only be accessed when creating an Observation. User will be able to record a maximum of 5 minutes per recording. The recording will be an mp4 file that can be shared by itself, or when sharing an Observation with an audio recording attached to it.

## Slide 29 — Getting Started • Gathering audio
- Tap the Audio button within an observation
- Allow CoMapeo microphone access
- Press the red record button to start and stop
- When you stop you get a success screen
- You can play back your recording

## Slide 30 — Using CoMapeo • Exchanging data
- Exchanging data
- Data can only be exchanged between devices which are on the same project.
- Data exchange happens in both directions, so Mobile A will get Mobile B’s data and vice versa.
- To exchange data devices have to be on the same network - it could be a wifi network with internet, or it could be a local network - eg. phone hotspot - without an internet connection.
- In Mapeo Legacy Exchange was called Synchronization.

## Slide 31 — Projects • Add Team
- Exchanging data
- Click the exchange button on the devices you wish to exchange data.
- Check they are on the same network and project.
