USING COMAPEO

Using CoMapeo  •  First-time Use
After getting started, CoMapeo will always start in the Map view where you may begin exploring its features.
If you intend to map alone, and do not intend to gather observations for a project, then feel free to start using CoMapeo. 
If you intend to gather observations with a team, then either join or create the project first, before creating any observations.

What can I do without being part of a project?
Create and save observations
Import configuration and adjust preferences
Share individual observations via the device menu
Access settings like Security, Language, and Coordinates
Using CoMapeo  •  First-time Use
Current Limitations
Any observations taken before you are on a project will not be saved when you join or create a project later. All your observations will be lost!
When not on a project you cannot connect with other devices and sync.
The future of Mapeo: Refactoring

This year we are launching “CoMapeo”, a major upgrade to the Mapeo platform that lays the foundation for the next chapter of Mapeo’s development: improved reliability, performance, security, and highly-demanded new features like GPS tracking and audio and video recording.

The new peer-to-peer database that powers CoMapeo is called “Mapeo Core”. This new database increases stability and enables new features including:

CREATING A PROJECT

Projects  •  Create a Project
CoMapeo has two roles available for teams: Project Coordinator and Project Participant.

Projects
Mapping territories takes teams.
Easy-to-create, encrypted Projects enable groups of territory monitors and mappers to work together on their mapping efforts.
Participants are invited to Projects using a project key that is randomly generated inside the app and shared via secure invites. 
Easily add as many devices to a CoMapeo project, manage that project securely, and always know who is part of the project.

Projects are easy-to-create, encrypted, private mapping databases for collaboration. 
With Projects, coordinators can define the categories of mapping data they will gather, share, and store with each other’s devices for a consistent experience.
Participants can also securely share and store their mapping data with others using a peer-to-peer model. 
Data gathered by members of a project is resilient and community owned.

Tracks

Tracks show the paths monitors and mappers take across their territories. 
They connect individual Observations into sequential sets, adding a richer dimension to evidence gathered and territory storytelling.
With Tracks, territory monitors and mappers record geo-referenced routes taken on designated outings, potentially highlighting anything from illegal logging roads to boundaries of a deforested area.

SPACE MANAGER

Storing all data locally on an embedded database on each device makes CoMapeo extremely resilient. Every device becomes a backup, and data is not stored on a server that could become inaccessible and is out of users control. However, every device storing _all_ data in a project means that disk space is eventually going to become an issue.
Managing and communicating media from remote areas with limited or no internet or cell phone access is one of the biggest challenges for frontline earth defenders. In order to gather and synchronize media (such as audio files) on low-end phones with limited memory, we will implement a media management interfaces tha…

COMAPEO
CONTEXT

Harmful resource extraction and human rights violations by governments and corporations persist on Indigenous territories across the world.
Through traditional knowledges of their lands, Indigenous communities are best positioned to fight back with territory monitoring and mapping.
However, existing digital tools to support their efforts are costly, difficult to use, rely exclusively on internet and phone connectivity, and do not enable sufficient autonomy.
Long-form text

By mapping their territories, Indigenous communities are best positioned to fight back exploitation and extraction of their lands. 
However, existing mapping technologies fall short on multiple fronts.
Concise Text

Introducing CoMapeo: A New Mapping Tool for Territory Monitors & Mappers
CoMapeo helps Indigenous communities easily and securely manage their mapping data and observations—completely offline.

CoMapeo uses an embedded peer-to-peer database and works completely offline.
The Mobile app enables monitors and mappers to gather evidence in the field, recording GPS points and photographs.
The Desktop app helps coordinators to organize data collected on mobile or GPS, and to visualize, edit data, create printed reports and publish a map online.



Simple to learn. Easy-to-use. Customizable.
CoMapeo uses an embedded peer-to-peer database and works completely offline.
The Mobile app enables monitors and mappers to gather evidence in the field, recording GPS points and photographs.
The Desktop app helps coordinators to organize data collected on mobile or GPS, and to visualize, edit data, create printed reports and publish a map online.

CoMapeo has no centralized database in an office or online.
Instead, communities collaborate on a shared database without internet. These databases are embedded in each app and allow data to be securely shared with other users over a local wireless connection completely offline. 
Data that users collect with CoMapeo Mobile stays on their phone. They can also view data collected by others on their team without altering it. 
Full local ownership and privacy of data at all times.

OBSERVATIONS

Observations with Audio Recordings
Is it too much info to say they’re 5 mins MP3s recordings ?

There might be a reason to get into the weeds, so I would include it in the Mega Deck version vs. the MVP version.

A forest cleared for gold-mining. A palm plantation in virgin forest.A story told by an elder. 
These are examples of observations used as key evidence in addressing critical climate threats and protecting cultural territorial legacies. 
Now with Audio recording, earth defenders can add their own words and testimonies to the data they gather—capturing the full extent of environmental harm not easily done with a single photo.
RK: I might add something about storytelling too; e.g. oral history about the lands. So the focus is not solely on documenting violations


Observations with Audio Recordings
If partner quote mentioning these features, add here

Observations are mapping data points brought to life with multimedia documentation.

CASE STUDY PRESENTATIONS

Waorani Mapping Project
In 2015, the Waorani people of Ecuador invited us to support them in creating a map of their territory. They had seen the way that oil drilling had devastated nearby areas, and they wanted to map their land in order to protect it.

We started by supporting them to create paper maps where the communities could identify what was important to them

They designed over 300 icons of what they wanted to map. 

We worked with them to co-design our flagship tool, Mapeo, 

which enabled them to make the maps themselves, in their territory, despite being days travel away from internet access


They made beautiful digital maps

And printed paper maps for each community along the way.

We were deeply engaged with them, when, three years into the process the government announced a new oil block on their land. 

The Waorani community used the maps as a key part of a lawsuit challenging the legality of the oil concession, 

and in 2019 officially won their court case, protecting their territory from future oil drilling.


I’ve always loved maps, but supporting the Waorani procres helped me realize just how powerful a tool they can be. From a kid who was obsessed with protecting the environment, to a young activist who stood up for human rights, I’ve been on a lifelong journey to understand where my talents and passions could make the most impact.

During the Waorani mapping process, it wasn’t just the Waorani who made meaning from the maps -  for me, I saw a path where our team of geographers and technologists could contribute our talents to something the world desperately needs. At a time when Indigenous people like my friends pictured here protect 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity, we’ve seen firsthand that change does not come from technology, but from how people use it.
