LOGOS

CoMapeo is always spelled with an uppercase ‘C’ and uppercase ‘M’.
When represented as a logomark, ‘Co’ is in our brand orange and ‘Mapeo’ is in white. This logomark typically sits on a field of textured blue and this shape will depend on its application as described below.




MEDIA LOGO PLACEMENT
Application: Primary brand materials, white/light backgrounds, full-color printing
Use the full-color logo as the primary version whenever possible. Ensures maximum brand recognition and visual impact on light backgrounds and full-color applications.

READY FOR REVIEW: “Introducing CoMapeo” (Variant A)

Using CoMapeo  •  First-time Use
After getting started, CoMapeo will always start in the Map view where you may begin exploring its features.
If you intend to map alone, and do not intend to gather observations for a project, then feel free to start using CoMapeo. 
If you intend to gather observations with a team, then either join or create the project first, before creating any observations.

Projects  •  Create a Project
CoMapeo has two roles available for teams: Project Coordinator and Project Participant.
When you first open and use the app your device does not have a role, but your device can be invited to a project as a Participant or a Coordinator.  
If you create a project, then your device is the first Coordinator for that project automatically.

Grow Your Team  •  Invite Devices
Only Project Coordinators can invite other devices to teams.
Project Coordinators can only invite devices that are on the same wifi network that also have the CoMapeo app open.
How to Invite Devices:
Go to the “Menu → Project Settings → Your Team.”
OR immediately after creating a project by tapping [Invite Devices]

Projects
Mapping territories takes teams.
Easy-to-create, encrypted Projects enable groups of territory monitors and mappers to work together on their mapping efforts.
Participants are invited to Projects using a project key that is randomly generated inside the app and shared via secure invites. 
Easily add as many devices to a CoMapeo project, manage that project securely, and always know who is part of the project.

Projects are easy-to-create, encrypted, private mapping databases for collaboration. 
With Projects, coordinators can define the categories of mapping data they will gather, share, and store with each other’s devices for a consistent experience.
Participants can also securely share and store their mapping data with others using a peer-to-peer model. 
Data gathered by members of a project is resilient and community owned.

TRACKS

Every monitoring trek is a story. 
CoMapeo already leverages phones’ built-in GPS to geo-reference photos and observations documenting environmental harm. 
Recording georeferenced tracks add new dimensions to evidence and story-telling, enabling users to record the path of an illegal logging road or the boundary of a deforested area.
If partner quote mentioning these features, add here

Tracks

Tracks show the paths monitors and mappers take across their territories. 
They connect individual Observations into sequential sets, adding a richer dimension to evidence gathered and territory storytelling.
With Tracks, territory monitors and mappers record geo-referenced routes taken on designated outings, potentially highlighting anything from illegal logging roads to boundaries of a deforested area.

EXCHANGING OBSERVATIONS

Secure sharing made easy for all members of a team.
Data Sharing allows community partners to easily bring together and coordinate their mapping data across multiple devices—simply and transparently.
Without depending on internet access, which can be slow and unreliable, any time teams share the same router they can see which new Observations are available for sharing.
Then, with a tap of a button, teams can see how many devices are updating and its progress along the way.

CASE STUDIES

In 2023, the Siekopai in Ecuador won a landmark court case regaining rights to their ancestral homelands, Pë’këya. 
Included in the court papers were maps created with Mapeo.
How We Help  •  Siekopai
“Siekopai Victory Case Study” Slide

Map making enabled new generations of Siekopai to connect with the land which their grandparents were forcefully evicted from in the 1940s. 
It also allowed them to understand the role of Pë’këya in keeping their culture and stories alive today.

# ADDITIONAL CONTEXT & NARRATIVES

## ABOUT "MEGA DECK"
This document compiles slides for comms and product support materials. It acts as a living document for brand assets and key messages.

## AWANA DIGITAL
Awana Digital works in solidarity with Indigenous Communities to use technology to defend their rights and fight climate change.
Awana Digital is a 501c3 non-profit organization registered in the United States.

## COMAPEO CONTEXT (Why CoMapeo?)
**Long-form:**
Harmful resource extraction and human rights violations by governments and corporations persist on Indigenous territories across the world.
Through traditional knowledges of their lands, Indigenous communities are best positioned to fight back with territory monitoring and mapping.
However, existing digital tools to support their efforts are costly, difficult to use, rely exclusively on internet and phone connectivity, and do not enable sufficient autonomy.

**Concise:**
By mapping their territories, Indigenous communities are best positioned to fight back exploitation and extraction of their lands.
However, existing mapping technologies fall short on multiple fronts.

## INTRODUCING COMAPEO (Narrative)
**Long-form:**
Introducing CoMapeo: A Collaboration Tool for Indigenous Territory Monitoring & Mapping.
CoMapeo helps Indigenous communities easily and securely manage their mapping data and observations—completely offline.
CoMapeo was co-designed with Indigenous Communities and centers Indigenous Data Sovereignty.

**Concise:**
Easily and securely manage monitoring observations and mapping data—completely offline.

**Platform Description:**
A fully developed platform built to support Indigenous-led territory monitoring & mapping work.
The platform consists of a mobile app, a desktop app, and a back-end decentralized database.
Together they enable Indigenous Communities to manage and control their own data, even when they are offline and far from an internet or cell phone connection.

## DETAILED CASE STUDY: WAORANI MAPPING PROJECT
In 2015, the Waorani people of Ecuador invited us to support them in creating a map of their territory. They had seen the way that oil drilling had devastated nearby areas, and they wanted to map their land in order to protect it.

We started by supporting them to create paper maps where the communities could identify what was important to them. They designed over 300 icons of what they wanted to map.
We worked with them to co-design our flagship tool, Mapeo, which enabled them to make the maps themselves, in their territory, despite being days travel away from internet access.
They made beautiful digital maps and printed paper maps for each community along the way.

We were deeply engaged with them, when, three years into the process the government announced a new oil block on their land.
The Waorani community used the maps as a key part of a lawsuit challenging the legality of the oil concession, and in 2019 officially won their court case, protecting their territory from future oil drilling.

## FUTURE COMAPEO & ROADMAP
**Goals:**
- Easy onboarding for new users
- Simplify creating and inviting others to a project
- Clear guidance and instructions in the app
- Gathering data in the field: Video and audio recording, GPS tracking
- Easy customization of categories, icons & forms for data collection
- Link data that changes over time
- Sharing & publishing data: Improved reporting, Large-format map printing & export
- Integration with other tools: One-click webmap publishing

**Projects 2.0:**
Multiple Projects, Categories Editor, Maps Manager (tile downloader), Expanded Units.

**Secured Sharing 2.0:**
Archive, Alerts, Data Export.

## SPACE MANAGER (Concept)
Storing all data locally on an embedded database on each device makes CoMapeo extremely resilient. Every device becomes a backup, and data is not stored on a server that could become inaccessible and is out of users control. However, every device storing _all_ data in a project means that disk space is eventually going to become an issue.
Managing and communicating media from remote areas with limited or no internet or cell phone access is one of the biggest challenges for frontline earth defenders. In order to gather and synchronize media (such as audio files) on low-end phones with limited memory, we will implement a media management interfaces that... (text cuts off in source).
