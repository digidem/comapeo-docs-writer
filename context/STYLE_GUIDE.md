### :comapeo_logo_circle: About this Style Guide

The objective of this Style Guide is to support all contributors in the writing and reviewing process for CoMapeo Product Support materials. 

Because materials will be the result of a collaborative process, with contributions from different voices and styles within the Product Support team, we aim to have a shared set of guidelines that gives consistency to the content we create, knowing that it is key to accessibility and clarity for diverse users.

### 📢Audience. *Who are you writing for?*

Imagine both Mapeo Legacy and CoMapeo users and potential users as your readers. 

- Consider that they may be starting fresh with the tool, or may already be exploring CoMapeo previous versions. Some may as well be users of Mapeo Legacy who are now expecting to get to know how CoMapeo works.
- Think of them as readers who are familiar with how CoMapeo works as a p2p mapping tool, and general app use terms (”Open, close, save, edit, delete, observations, GPS…”) - you don’t have to explain the whole App or any basic information.
- However,  this does not mean the intended audience is people with a technical backgrounds. Readers may have diverse backgrounds (i.e, community members, decision-makers, NGO / non Indigenous allies) and different levels of confidence with technology (from [New Tech User](https://www.notion.so/New-Tech-User-13a31b7db8b1407a9a5b5125748fd1ec?pvs=21) to [Advanced Tech User](https://www.notion.so/Advanced-Tech-User-3929712645dd4905877c3b9a46309f9f?pvs=21))

* When in doubt, think of yourself as a [Intermediate Tech User](https://www.notion.so/Intermediate-Tech-User-708cdd512e1440dc81a8aac95446f5ae?pvs=21) who is new with CoMapeo, to identify what information would make you feel more confident in navigating this new version.

### Language and tone. *How are you speaking to this audience?*

From our Glossary updates work, we know that we want to ensure that we’re using clear and concrete words to describe key app features and functions in accessible and meaningful ways.

- Use an imperative and action-oriented voice (i.e “Press XX then go to XX”)
- Be as straightforward and concise as possible.
    - Avoid expressive tone (!) or use of adjectives.
    - Aim to use simpler, everyday terms.
    - Avoid complicated clauses.
- Use an active voices. Avoid “this action will take you to, this would mean that…” when not necessary.
- Less is more. Aim to write short sentences that make the information accessible to all kinds of readers. Think of what users would like to know first about each piece of information, and add only details that you think are relevant.
- Be as literal as possible. For example, speaking of equipment, name the devices. Use “Wi-Fi router” instead of “Wi-Fi” to make it more concrete. “Wi-Fi” alone could imply that CoMapeo requires internet connectivity when it does not.

### Style

- Consistency is key. If you start describing the steps in one way, stick with it. Remember that this is technical writing, not literary. So don’t be afraid of repeating terms (we want repetition!)
- Add a link to other sections when useful (see “See format for links and highlights in the next block of this guide)
- Avoid brackets or parentheses. If it needs explanation, do it within the context of it.
    - If you want to add a paragraph or a side note, you can use 👉🏾 emoji to add a separate paragraph (see block below)
- Think of your writing as going from general explanations and the most common actions, towards detail and the most unique actions.
    - The structure is there to help you. Follow the main order:
    1. Title
    2. Hero image
    3. Table of contents (in this page we’ll learn…) 
    4. Subtitles

## Format for Links and Highlights

Use the following emojis for 

💡**Tip.** This is information that will not determine the success of the steps, but you consider relevant recommendations for users.

Example: 💡 Tip: You can also add audio recordings to Observations to provide context and narratives.

🔗 **Go to (other section)**. Use this to direct readers to other sections at the bottom of your paragraph, if you consider that the sections will be complementary.

**Example:** 🔗 Go to **Gathering the right equipment**

👉🏾 **More.** Use this emoji for information that you would normally add as a bracket or parenthesis. Not essential but complementary.

## Titles

- Keep them short and simple.
- Use verb action-oriented headers, ie. “Understanding Exchange”.
- Use feature names clearly. Capitalize them and write them in bold.

⚪

## Subtitles

- Break down large chunks of text into smaller paragraphs. This makes information more accessible to diverse kinds of readers.
- If your section is more than two paragraphs long, consider adding subtitles to improve readability
- Number step subtitles, consequently, and give them a title of 2-6 .

## Writing with visuals

- As you draft, add ideas for images that will support readers with the content.
- Think of images as complementary -  they support the text but the text should be clear enough alone.
</aside>

### Questions for PS team

- Should features be capitalized? (Exchange, Multi Projects)
    - Everywhere yes
- Should feature be in bold? (**Exchange, Multi Projects**)
    - only in intro/description paragraph
- Should steps have a title or just be listed as Step1, Step 2 (and so on)?  to explore still

## Sources and Citations

- Source of truth is the `context/` folder. Do not introduce information from memory or external sources.
- Always start from the quickstart index: `context/comapeo_support_materials/quickstart_guides/INDEX.md` to locate relevant materials.
- Treat `context/comapeo_support_materials/mapeo_docs/` as legacy (old Mapeo). Never use its technical/app‑specific instructions. Only reuse high‑level, non‑app context if strictly necessary.
- Add the final `Sources:` line only in `referenced.md` (not in `index.md`), listing exact file paths used. Separate multiple paths with semicolons.
- If a needed detail is missing in `context/`, add a clear TODO instead of inferring.

Examples
