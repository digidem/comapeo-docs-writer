Introducing new media formats, such as audio files, to CoMapeo increases the chances of a user running out of disk space. CoMapeo now allows user on low-end phones with limited memory to selectively exchange data and avoid using too much disk space. Available via the updated Exchange screen, this first phase of the feature will enable you to :

- **Exchange previews** -  The interface will only consider current media and will not exchange audio.
- **Exchange everything** - set by default. This mean you would be able to exchange all media, including audio. You could consider this device the “archive device” in your team.

### **Details**

- We have been transitioning away from using the word “sync” and now using the word “exchange”.  We have done a Copy Audit to replace it in CoMapeo, vut is possible you may find the word “sync” somewhere we may have missed
- When exchanging previews, audio will be exchanged but not usable. When you tap on the audio file, it will not work and an error will appear
- When the device is exchanging data, the link Exchange Settings will not be visible

### Known issue

- **Exchange previews** is supposed to be set by default. An update to this is currently in development.
