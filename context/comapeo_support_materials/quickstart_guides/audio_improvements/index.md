### Background

[Audio Recording MVP](%F0%9F%8F%81%20CoMapeo%20Mobile%201%201%200%20-%20Audio,%20Tracks,%20Map%20File%20P%201eb1b08162d58043bed7c04fbe25bee5/CoMapeo%20Mobile%201%201%200%20-%20Audio,%20Tracks,%20Map%20File%20Pic%201341b08162d5804a9000dc4718f725f5.md) was released in CoMapeo early 2025. Since then, we have been gathering feedback from the Awana Digital team and our partners during field trainings. 

### What‚Äôs New

These improvements address the following feedback:

- When tapping the Audio icon, it was expected the recording would start automatically
- Once a recording was complete, it was unclear how to proceed next
    - The UI to save a recording is unclear

### Saving an Audio Recording

**Instructions**

1. When an Audio Recording is stopped (either by reaching 5 minutes or the Stop button being tapped), the Saved Audio screen will appear. 
    
    > Note: At this point, the Audio Recording is attached to the Observation BUT the Observation itself is not yet saved.
    > 
2. On the Saved Audio screen you can;
    - See the length of the recording
    - Play to the Audio Recording
    - Delete the Audio Recording
        
        > When you tap on  Delete, you will go back to the Observation.
        > 
    - Close the Audio Recording, by tapping on Back to Editing, and return to the New Observation editor.

When you tap on  Back to Editing, you will see the Audio Thumbnail version of the recording now attached to the Observation.
