The¬†**App Passcode**¬†allows a user to protect CoMapeo from casual prying eyes (such as somebody picking up someone's phone and browsing the app). However, feedback from users highlighted the risk that when faced with a physical threat, a user could just be forced to enter their password. In an attempt to mitigate this,¬†**Obscure Mode**¬†would hide the actual data and would display an empty version of CoMapeo.
