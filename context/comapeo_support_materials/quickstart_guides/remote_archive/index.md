Formerly known as ‚ÄúMapeo Cloud Sync‚Äù, **Remote Archive** allows you to exchange data over the internet without needing to be on the same wifi and location as another user. This version of the feature, called ‚ÄúCommunity Edition‚Äù, is designed to run on a server with no UI for editing or viewing the data ‚Äî it is just for exchange and storage of data.

**How do I start Remote Archive?**

1. Create a project on CoMapeo and have the link to the server you would like to exchange data with.
2. Open the menu and tap [Project Settings], then [Remote Archive]
    1. If no server was added, you will see ‚ÄúRemote Archive is OFF‚Äù
3. Tap  [Remote Archive] and then tap [+ Add Remote Archive]
4. In the URL field, type or copy/paste the URL to the server
    1. If you‚Äôre copying the URL, make sure to remove any `http:` or replace it with `https:`. You can‚Äôt add insecure HTTP servers. For example, `comapeo.example` and `https://comapeo.example` are okay, but `http://comapeo.example` is not.
5. If successful, tap [Project Settings] then [Your Team], you will see the server under Participants
