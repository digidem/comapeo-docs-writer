# What is CoMapeo? {#what-is-comapeo .unnumbered}

CoMapeo is a mapping and territory-monitoring tool created together with
Indigenous communities. It was designed to respond directly to their
priorities: documenting what is happening on their lands, telling their
stories, and protecting their rights.

Unlike many digital tools that are expensive, complex, or dependent on
the internet, CoMapeo is simple to learn, works offline, and keeps full
control of information in the hands of the community. This means it can
be used in remote areas, on affordable phones, and by people with
different levels of digital experience.

Because it was co-designed with Indigenous partners across multiple
continents, CoMapeo reflects their knowledge and way of working.
Communities use it to map cultural sites, monitor environmental threats,
record oral histories, and strengthen their stewardship of the land.

At its core, CoMapeo is more than a piece of software: it is a tool for
accessibility, autonomy, and collaboration --- enabling frontline
communities to gather and share information safely, in ways that serve
their own goals.

# What are CoMapeo's core concepts and functions? {#what-are-comapeos-core-concepts-and-functions .unnumbered}

-   Observations: Observations are the main way to collect information
    in CoMapeo. Besides the location, timestamp and category, they can
    also include photos, audios and details.

-   Tracks: Tracks let you record paths or boundaries as you move across
    the land. They are useful for documenting trails, patrol routes,
    rivers, or territory borders.

-   Projects: Projects organize your mapping work, either individually
    or with collaborators. They define the categories, team members, and
    settings for how data is collected and managed.

-   Exchange: Exchange is how devices share and synchronize project
    data. It allows collaborators to keep their observations up to date,
    even without internet access.

Observations are the heart of CoMapeo. They allow you to capture data
about what you see in the field, including text, photos, audios, and
location.

CoMapeo Mobile is designed to work on a variety of Android devices., It
uses the basic hardware included in most smartphones today: a camera,
GPS, battery, and memory. However, if you plan to use CoMapeo on long
journeys, offline environments, and diverse weather conditions on the
land, then there are important aspects to look for in a phone that can
improve your experience with CoMapeo throughout your journey.

# Why is organizing key materials important? {#why-is-organizing-key-materials-important .unnumbered}

CoMapeo comes with default options that can be used right away, without
any customization.

If you want CoMapeo to respond to the local needs and desires of your
project, community, or territory, it is key that you organize the
information that you need to customize the tool to meet your needs. One
key step in this process is the customization of **Categories**,or
pre-defined labels for organizing Observations within a Project.

# About Categories in CoMapeo {#about-categories-in-comapeo .unnumbered}

### **What is a category in CoMapeo?** {#what-is-a-category-in-comapeo .unnumbered}

A category is a predetermined icon, label, and detail questions for any
data type being collected. For each observation made with CoMapeo,
participants select a category to classify it, and may answer questions
or respond to prompts to provide more detail about what is being
documented.

**What are Category Sets in CoMapeo?**

Previously known as *Config* in Mapeo, Category Sets are files that
contain and define the distinct Categories for a Project. Creating
config used to require coding skills that limited the possibility for
people to customize their own categories. We have now made it more
accessible through a spreadsheet template that we explain in this
section.

# CoMapeo\'s Default Category Set {#comapeos-default-category-set .unnumbered}

When you first install CoMapeo, it comes with a default category set
that includes general icons and questions for territory mapping and
monitoring. Depending on your needs and capacity, you may find that the
Default Category Set that comes with CoMapeo does the job well enough,
or you might want to set up a custom Category Set with your own icons

# Creating Custom Category Sets {#creating-custom-category-sets .unnumbered}

[\[VIDEO WALKTHROUGH\]]{.mark}

**Reasons for customizing CoMapeo Category Sets**

-   Custom Categories are a powerful tool for customization in CoMapeo,
    allowing users to define specific icons, and questionnaires for
    their projects.

-   Text can be written in any language that can be typed, ensuring that
    key parts of the data collection interface can appear in the native
    language of the groups using it.

**Reflect and organize information you will need**

Initial planning and consultation with project participants is essential
to designing effective ways of organizing your data. To start the
customization process, project participants should reflect on the
project goals, what kind of data will be needed, and what properties
might be required for data outputs.

You will need to think through what to include for each of the **key
customizable areas of CoMapeo.**

-   **[[Categories]{.underline}](https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/customization-options/custom-configurations/creating-custom-configurations/planning-configuration-and-data-structure/categories).**
    When collecting or creating data with CoMapeo, users assign a
    top-level category to each observation or element on the map.

-   **[[Icons]{.underline}](https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/customization-options/custom-configurations/creating-custom-configurations/planning-configuration-and-data-structure/icons).**
    Each Category you include must have an icon or a small graphic to
    display to users when selecting a category.

-   [**[Details
    fields.]{.underline}**](https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/customization-options/custom-configurations/creating-custom-configurations/planning-configuration-and-data-structure/details-fields)
    For each Category in your Category Set, you can include one or more
    structured data fields (like a mini form or questionnaire) that
    users can optionally fill out when creating a new observation or map
    element with that category.

Once you have this information, use the **CoMapeo Category Generator
Spreadsheet** to create your categories. This tool will allow you to
create and edit Categories, icons, details fields and language, and
export all this information into a **.comapeocat** file, which you will
import to your phone (and share among participants if you are on the
same project) to start documenting and exchanging information.

|                            | *configuration* file, and want to work  |

|                            | Category Set, start in Step 1. If you   |

|                            |     CoMapeo Category Set.               |

# What is possible when mapping as a team? {#what-is-possible-when-mapping-as-a-team .unnumbered}

Mapping with others makes the work more powerful. When a group collects
information together, you can cover more ground, include different
perspectives, and build a shared record of what is happening on your
land. It also helps distribute responsibility so no one person carries
the entire workload.

# Organizing Your Team {#organizing-your-team .unnumbered}

[\[VIDEO WALKTHROUGH\]]{.mark}

Start by deciding who will be part of your team and what roles each
person will play.

+------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
|                        | **Step 1**                                  |
|                        |                                             |
|                        | Choose who will collect observations, who   |
|                        | will organize the data, and who will share  |
|                        | results with the wider group.               |
+========================+=============================================+
|                        | **Step 2**                                  |
|                        |                                             |
|                        | Agree on simple protocols before you start: |
|                        | how to record data, how often to sync, and  |
|                        | how to keep sensitive information safe.     |

# Uninstalling CoMapeo {#uninstalling-comapeo .unnumbered}

## **Reasons for Uninstalling CoMapeo** {#reasons-for-uninstalling-comapeo .unnumbered}

You might want to uninstall CoMapeo for a number of reasons, for
example:

-   You have decided that the tool isn't the right one for you

-   You are no longer part of certain projects

-   You want to give your phone away to someone else

-   You think your device and the data are not secure

However, there are irreversible consequences to uninstalling CoMapeo, so
make sure you are sure about your reasons, and look at the checklist
below before completing the uninstallation.

## **Before Uninstalling CoMapeo** {#before-uninstalling-comapeo .unnumbered}

When you uninstall CoMapeo all the data within the app will be deleted
and will not be recoverable. You will also lose access to any projects
you are part of, even if you are a coordinator. Therefore please follow
these steps before uninstalling CoMapeo.

-   If you are not part of any team projects, but are only using CoMapeo
    on your own, make sure you export any data from within all solo
    projects you have, or share any individual observation data that you
    consider important via Whatsapp / email etc.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  🔗 Go to **EXPORT DATA**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

-   If you are part of one or more projects, make sure that you are up
    to date with your data exchange, so that any data you have collected
    can be part of the team data.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  🔗 Go to **UNDERSTANDING HOW EXCHANGE WORKS**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

-   If you are a coordinator on a project, make sure that you set up at
    least one other device as a coordinator device for the project. If
    you fail to do this then the project will only have participants,
    and certain actions will not be possible.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  🔗 Go to **Managing a Team**

# Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting-5 .unnumbered}

## **Deleting your app data** {#deleting-your-app-data .unnumbered}

You might want to delete your app data without deleting CoMapeo off your
phone. This might be useful if you have come across bugs or want to
start fresh with CoMapeo. Clearing data deletes all the contents of the
app, and resets it back to its default state, like when it was first
installed. If you have limited or no internet access this might be
useful, as you can start from scratch by deleting app data, without
having to re-download CoMapeo from the playstore.

## **Instructions** {#instructions .unnumbered}

Steps might vary slightly depending on Android version, but will be
something like:

1.  Go to **Settings** and then **Apps & notifications** (or just
    **Apps**)

2.  Tap **CoMapeo**

3.  Tap **Storage** or **Storage & cache** and then **Clear data** (make
    sure you clear data and not just cache)

4.  **Confirm** that you want to clear the data

On Android 11 and higher, "Clear data" was renamed to "clear storage".

Some older Android versions may also have a Clear data button directly
on the app info screen.

# Why invite collaborators to your projects? {#why-invite-collaborators-to-your-projects .unnumbered}

When mapping on your own, there are three ways to start collaborating
with others using CoMapeo.

-   Inviting a Collaborator to My Solo Project

-   Starting a New Project

-   Joining an Existing Project

# Inviting a Collaborator to My Solo Project {#inviting-a-collaborator-to-my-solo-project .unnumbered}

[\[VIDEO WALKTHROUGH\]]{.mark}

When mapping on your own, your first project is simply My Solo Project
to which you can gather a limitless amount of observations. If you'd
like to share observations in My Solo Project using CoMapeo's Exchange
feature, then you will first need to give the project a name. Once the
project has been successfully renamed, then you are ready to invite
devices to this renamed project and use the Exchange feature.

# What is a Remote Archive? {#what-is-a-remote-archive .unnumbered}

A **Remote Archive** is a dedicated server that allows projects to
automatically back up their observations whenever connected to the
internet.

-   Any device can be considered a server as long as it is in perpetual
    state of being available to exchange observations.

-   Internet connectivity is required to both add a Remote Archive and
    to exchange with it.

-   Only Coordinators can enable a Remote Archive, and once enabled
    Participants can see it as part of the participants list.

-   When enabled, all new collaborators that opt-in to exchange their
    observations will automatically be doing so with the Remote Archive.

# Step 1: Generate a Remote Archive URL {#step-1-generate-a-remote-archive-url .unnumbered}

Familiarity and comfort with coding will help with generating a Remote
Archive URL.

## Exchanging with a Remote Archive {#exchanging-with-a-remote-archive .unnumbered}

If enabled and connected to the internet, Remote Archive will
automatically backup every time a device starts an Exchange.

Attention: On CoMapeo Mobile 1.2.0 it is not possible to not exchange
with the Remote Archive but this is a feature that may come in the
future.

## Removing a Remote Archive {#removing-a-remote-archive .unnumbered}

​​It is not currently possible to remove a Remote Archive from a Project
once added. We anticipate having the ability to remove a Remote Archive
available in late 2025.

-   When it becomes available, only Coordinators will be able to add and
    remove a Remote Archive from their projects

-   In this version and in the future, participants cannot remove the
    Remote Archive from the project.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting-18 .unnumbered}

-   

## Coming Soon {#coming-soon-16 .unnumbered}

In the coming year, improvements to Remote Archives will include:

-   Allowing Coordinators to remove a Remote Archive

-   Making it easier process to add a Remote Archive

On CoMapeo Mobile, you can clear the application cache using the Android
system settings. Note that clearing the application "cache" is very
different from clearing the application "storage". Applications
typically use the cache to store non-permanent data to improve app
experience and it is generally safe to remove that data.
