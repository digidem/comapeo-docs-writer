*   **Understanding CoMapeo’s Core Concepts and Functions:** A Notion page (in the CoMapeo Docs database) introducing CoMapeo and its key features[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2331b08162d580149804c4e4a8ee4205)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2331b08162d580149804c4e4a8ee4205). It answers _“What is CoMapeo?”_ and defines core concepts like **Observations, Tracks, Projects,** and **Exchange**, including their purpose and how they work[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2331b08162d580149804c4e4a8ee4205)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2331b08162d580149804c4e4a8ee4205). This is essentially the intro section of the user guide, emphasizing CoMapeo’s offline-first design and co-designed origins.

*   **Installing CoMapeo / Uninstalling CoMapeo:** Two Notion pages that walk through app installation and first-time setup, as well as safe removal of the app. The **Installing CoMapeo** guide covers how to find and download the app (Android-only via Play Store or direct APK), initial permissions (camera, location), and prepping the device for first use[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d58082bc0eec7c70f62a30)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d58082bc0eec7c70f62a30). The **Uninstalling CoMapeo** guide explains reasons one might uninstall and provides a **checklist before uninstalling** – e.g. ensuring data is backed up or exchanged, and transferring coordinator role if applicable – and then how to remove the app[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d5800480d2eb20978de0cf)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d5800480d2eb20978de0cf). It warns that uninstalling deletes all app data, so users should export important observations and sync with teammates before proceeding[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d5800480d2eb20978de0cf)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d5800480d2eb20978de0cf).

*   **Gathering the Right Equipment for CoMapeo:** A Notion article focusing on hardware and accessories needed for effective field use of CoMapeo[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2621b08162d580b59f9bdf24fbbe58de)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2621b08162d580b59f9bdf24fbbe58de). It emphasizes that CoMapeo runs on Android devices only and lists what to look for in a smartphone: long battery life, ample memory (or an SD card for offloading media), durable/waterproof build (or a good case), good camera and GPS sensitivity[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2621b08162d580b59f9bdf24fbbe58de)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2621b08162d580b59f9bdf24fbbe58de). It also notes the need for a portable Wi-Fi router or hotspot device to use the Exchange feature offline among team members[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2621b08162d580b59f9bdf24fbbe58de). This section ensures users prepare appropriate equipment before heading out mapping.

*   **Organizing Key Materials for Projects:** A guide in Notion about preparing “materials” before mapping, specifically focusing on Category Sets and other project resources. It explains what **categories** are in CoMapeo (each category has an icon, label, and optional detail questions) and why planning a good category schema is important[Notion](https://www.notion.so/26a1b08162d5800597a1ce0ff6f309d7). This likely includes tips on gathering any reference data, forms, or maps needed, and how to use CoMapeo’s category configuration tools to set up a project’s custom categories ahead of time. _(Note: The Notion page is in progress, but it centers on categories and project setup.)_

*   **Mapping with Collaborators:** A section covering best practices for collaborative mapping in CoMapeo. This likely outlines how multiple people can work on the same project – for example, how everyone should join the project, collect observations, and use Exchange to sync data regularly. It reinforces that **Exchange** allows a team to share data over a local network without internet[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2381b08162d580e2a5eecae57f6f02ed)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2381b08162d580e2a5eecae57f6f02ed). This topic sets the stage for working in teams, complementing the technical “How Exchange Works” section with more workflow-oriented advice for collaborators in the field.

*   **Mapping on Your Own & Next Steps:** (Planned content) Guidance for solo mappers and transitioning projects. It would address scenarios like starting with a solo project and later inviting others, or leaving a project. Likely includes how to **leave a project or remove a device**, how to add new collaborators or projects later, and how to share data out after mapping. _(This was listed in the outline, though a dedicated page was not found; it will tie together features like project invites, Exchange, and data sharing for someone finishing mapping.)_

*   **Creating a New Observation:** A step-by-step Notion guide on using CoMapeo to record an observation in the field. It details the process: from the map screen, tap the **“+” button**, choose a category for the observation, then add a description, photos or audio, and any detail fields, and finally save the observation[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xAC7-L_WmbQaVAopZ2UVkVJ2vO5KhYJYdWiOrFBluU)[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xAC7-L_WmbQaVAopZ2UVkVJ2vO5KhYJYdWiOrFBluU). It likely includes tips such as adding audio for context. (In the support content, this corresponds to the “Gathering Observations” section and includes screenshots or illustrations of the UI).

*   **Creating a New Track:** Similar to the above, this guide explains how to record a GPS track in CoMapeo. It describes opening the Tracks menu (walking figure icon), starting a track to log your path, letting CoMapeo draw the trail as you move, then stopping and saving the track with a name[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xAC7-L_WmbQaVAopZ2UVkVJ2vO5KhYJYdWiOrFBluU)[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xAC7-L_WmbQaVAopZ2UVkVJ2vO5KhYJYdWiOrFBluU). This is useful for mapping patrol routes, trails, or boundaries. The documentation likely points out that you need to grant location permissions and keep the device on while tracking.

*   **Adding Audio Recording to Observations:**_(Coming Soon)_ This topic will cover how to record audio within an observation (a new feature in CoMapeo). As context, an internal quick-start guide _“CoMapeo Mobile – Audio Improvements”_ describes the introduction of audio recording in CoMapeo v5 and subsequent UI improvements[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2171b08162d5801cb8ebd2d6ced9a444)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2171b08162d5801cb8ebd2d6ced9a444). It notes that audio recording is done within the Observation editor and details the workflow: tap the microphone icon, grant microphone permission, the recording starts immediately, and a visual indicator (blue bar) shows recording progress[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2171b08162d5801cb8ebd2d6ced9a444)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2171b08162d5801cb8ebd2d6ced9a444). The support docs will use this to instruct users how to attach audio clips to their observations and save them.

*   **Managing the Observations List:** A page intended to show users how to use the Observations list view in the app. This likely includes how to scroll through all observations, view summary info, and perhaps filter or search within the list. (At the moment, the Notion page is a placeholder with the title[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2331b08162d58049a796f00ff29c3e7f), but the concept is to help users manage many observations.) For example, tips might include sorting by date, checking which observations have been synced, etc., to keep data organized.

*   **Reviewing an Observation (Details, GPS Info, Photo Info):** This section (planned in Notion) is about inspecting a single saved observation in detail. It would cover viewing an observation’s metadata – e.g., seeing the exact GPS coordinates and accuracy, viewing photo details and attributions, and any entered description or answers. A major addition here is the **Photo Info** feature, which allows users to view and share metadata of a photo (to verify authenticity)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/1eb1b08162d580fa848af197a3eda9a0)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/1eb1b08162d580fa848af197a3eda9a0). The internal guide _“Exposing Photo Data”_ provides context: CoMapeo now displays photo metadata (timestamp, location, device/camera info, etc.) on a Photo Info screen, which the support doc will teach users how to access (by tapping a photo in an observation)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/1eb1b08162d580fa848af197a3eda9a0). This ensures users know how to review evidence attached to observations.

*   **Sharing Observations Outside of CoMapeo:** A guide for exporting or sending observation data to people who are not in the project. This might include using the “Share” button on an observation to send it via other apps (WhatsApp, email, etc.) or exporting all observations to a file format. For context, the uninstall guide advises sharing important observations via WhatsApp/email as one way to retain data[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d5800480d2eb20978de0cf). The dedicated support page likely compiles methods like **exporting a GeoJSON**, sharing an observation’s photo and info as a report, or generating a PDF. This ensures users can communicate their findings with external audiences or backup data outside the app.

*   **Managing Projects – Creating a New Project:** Step-by-step instructions to start a new project in CoMapeo[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHgSVe1wch8Dbcl4MOvZwb5x6Pg_5lnqEGjxC6J4e80). It covers going to the main menu, selecting “New Project”, giving the project a name, and understanding that if you plan to use a custom category set, you should import it at project creation time before collecting data[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHgSVe1wch8Dbcl4MOvZwb5x6Pg_5lnqEGjxC6J4e80)[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHgSVe1wch8Dbcl4MOvZwb5x6Pg_5lnqEGjxC6J4e80). (Any observations made prior to joining/creating a project remain only in “My Solo Project” and will not carry into the new project, which is noted as a limitation[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHgSVe1wch8Dbcl4MOvZwb5x6Pg_5lnqEGjxC6J4e80).) This page sets the foundation for multi-device collaboration by establishing a project space.

*   **Managing Projects – Adjusting the Categories Set:** Documentation on customizing a project’s observation categories. It explains that CoMapeo comes with default categories, but coordinators can import a **.comapeocat** file to use a bespoke category set[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHgSVe1wch8Dbcl4MOvZwb5x6Pg_5lnqEGjxC6J4e80)[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHgSVe1wch8Dbcl4MOvZwb5x6Pg_5lnqEGjxC6J4e80). The page would walk through: opening **Project Settings -> Categories**, viewing the current list, tapping “Import Config”, and choosing the category file from the device. After import, the new categories propagate to all project members on the next Exchange. This section uses the category config templates from Drive as examples and warns to do this **before** collecting data or inviting others (to avoid data loss or mismatch).

*   **Managing Projects – Inviting Collaborators:** This guide covers how a Project Coordinator can invite other devices to join a project. It likely describes the **Exchange/Invite flow**: showing the project QR code or using the device-to-device invite over Wi-Fi. It emphasizes roles: only Coordinators can invite others[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHgSVe1wch8Dbcl4MOvZwb5x6Pg_5lnqEGjxC6J4e80). The content would include that once invited, the new collaborator will receive the project data (including categories) via Exchange. This is crucial for team mapping, and the doc provides steps and troubleshooting (e.g. “Ensure both devices are on the same network for Exchange”).

*   **Managing Projects – Managing a Team:** Higher-level advice on administering a project team. It probably discusses managing member roles (promoting someone else to Coordinator or removing a participant) and ensuring project continuity. For instance, it would stress having at least two Coordinators in case one device is lost[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d5800480d2eb20978de0cf). It may also touch on best practices like regular Exchanges so all devices have up-to-date data (serving as backups on each device). Essentially, this section is about project governance and device management in CoMapeo.

*   **Managing Projects – Managing Multiple Projects:**_(Coming Soon)_ A section to cover CoMapeo’s support for multiple projects on one device (a new feature in v5). This will explain how users can add or switch between projects without losing data. It might include guidance on when to create separate projects (e.g. different initiatives or areas), and clarify that data does not automatically sync between projects. (The documentation note in _Core Concepts_ already hints that as of CoMapeo v5, multiple projects are allowed[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2331b08162d580149804c4e4a8ee4205).) This forthcoming page will serve as a guide for power users handling several projects simultaneously.

*   **Managing Data & Privacy – Adjusting Data Sharing & Privacy:** Documentation on CoMapeo’s settings related to data sharing and user privacy. This likely covers the **analytics/metrics opt-in** (telemetry data) that CoMapeo asks for on first launch[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHgSVe1wch8Dbcl4MOvZwb5x6Pg_5lnqEGjxC6J4e80) and how to change that choice later in **Settings -> Data Privacy**. It also covers project data sharing settings: for example, explaining that CoMapeo does not upload data to any server by default[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2381b08162d580e2a5eecae57f6f02ed), and how users can control Exchange (local only vs using Remote Archive). In short, this section ensures users understand what information stays local, what can be shared, and how to adjust those settings for safety and privacy.

*   **Managing Data & Privacy – Working with an App Passcode:** A Notion page about CoMapeo’s app-level security features. CoMapeo allows users to set a **5-digit passcode** to lock the app, preventing unauthorized access if the phone is shared or unattended[Notion](https://www.notion.so/1eb1b08162d580e39ec5ebc61b71d549). The guide provides steps to activate the App Passcode in the app’s Security settings and to disable it if needed[Notion](https://www.notion.so/1eb1b08162d580e39ec5ebc61b71d549). It also introduces **Obscure Passcode mode** – a feature where entering a special code will display a blank decoy version of the app, to protect sensitive data under duress[Notion](https://www.notion.so/1eb1b08162d580e39ec5ebc61b71d549). Instructions on using Obscure Mode (after setting a passcode) are included, so users facing a security threat can hide their data quickly.

*   **Exchanging Observations – Understanding How Exchange Works:** A detailed explanation (with diagrams) of CoMapeo’s peer-to-peer data sync feature[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2381b08162d580e2a5eecae57f6f02ed)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2381b08162d580e2a5eecae57f6f02ed). It defines Exchange as the method by which devices on the same project share new observations/tracks over a local Wi-Fi network, without internet. The document describes the conditions required (devices must be on the same Wi-Fi or hotspot) and the process: one user taps “Start Exchange” and others do the same, and data packets are passed around until everyone is up-to-date[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2381b08162d580e2a5eecae57f6f02ed)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2381b08162d580e2a5eecae57f6f02ed). It emphasizes there is **no central server** – data stays within the group’s devices – and that regular exchanges act as backups on each device[Notion](https://www.notion.so/2381b08162d580e2a5eecae57f6f02ed). This section provides the conceptual understanding needed before using Exchange in practice.

*   **Exchanging Observations – Using a Remote Archive:**_(Planned section)_ This will cover CoMapeo’s ability to sync via a “Remote Archive,” which is essentially an online server or cloud storage used when team members are not physically together. While Exchange normally works offline, Remote Archive allows asynchronous data exchange over the internet. The forthcoming documentation will explain how to set up a Remote Archive and use it to send/receive updates when devices can get online. (The Notion page is not yet filled out, but it falls under Exchange; it will complement the Exchange guide by describing the online method for data sync, useful for distributed teams.)

*   **Sharing Observations Outside CoMapeo:**_(See above in “Sharing Outside Your Project”)_ – This is essentially the same content area, ensuring users know how to get their data out of the app for reporting or collaboration with non-users.

*   **Ending a Project:**_(To be developed)_ In the support outline, this likely refers to winding down a mapping project. It may provide guidance on final data exports, archiving the project data, and possibly removing members or devices. While we did not find a specific doc for this, the concept is to ensure all data is saved (using Exchange and export) before everyone stops using the project, and to outline steps like designating a final data custodian or using the Remote Archive for long-term storage. This will use bits of other sections (Exchange, export, uninstall) as context to safely “end” a project.

*   **Troubleshooting – “I can’t start CoMapeo”:** Addresses issues where the app will not open or crashes on launch. Tips likely include verifying the device is compatible (CoMapeo only works on Android, not iPhone)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/24f1b08162d58082bc0eec7c70f62a30), making sure the app is updated to the latest version, and if on Android, checking that Unknown Sources is enabled if installing via APK. Reinstalling the app as a last resort might be suggested.

*   **Troubleshooting – “I have problems with GPS in CoMapeo Mobile”:** Help for when location data isn’t working correctly. The documentation suggests to **verify that GPS is enabled on the device and that CoMapeo has location permission** (if not, enable it in the phone’s settings)[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xAC7-L_WmbQaVAopZ2UVkVJ2vO5KhYJYdWiOrFBluU). It also advises using the device outdoors for a better signal and waiting for a GPS lock. If tracks aren’t recording, ensure high-accuracy location mode is on. Essentially, it guides users to check settings and environment when GPS issues arise.

*   **Troubleshooting – “I have problems with the camera in CoMapeo Mobile”:** Guidance for camera or photo issues. Likely recommendations are to check that CoMapeo has camera _and_ storage permissions (since taking photos requires saving files) – if not, enable those in Android settings. Also, ensure there is enough storage space on the device, because if the phone is full, photos cannot be saved (the outline’s draft notes mention observations not saving if storage is low)[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xAC7-L_WmbQaVAopZ2UVkVJ2vO5KhYJYdWiOrFBluU)[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xAC7-L_WmbQaVAopZ2UVkVJ2vO5KhYJYdWiOrFBluU). If the camera is slow or not focusing, it might suggest closing other apps or restarting the device.

*   **Troubleshooting – “I want to update app permissions in CoMapeo Mobile”:** Explains how to manually adjust permissions after initial setup. For instance, if a user initially denied the app certain permissions (camera, microphone, location), CoMapeo may not function fully. This guide tells the user to go into the **Android Settings > Apps > CoMapeo > Permissions** and toggle on the needed permissions[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xAC7-L_WmbQaVAopZ2UVkVJ2vO5KhYJYdWiOrFBluU). It likely enumerates which permissions CoMapeo needs and why (Camera for photos, Microphone for audio, Location for GPS, Storage for exporting files). This ensures users can fix functionality problems by granting proper access.

*   **Glossary:** A Quick Reference Glossary (work-in-progress on Notion) that defines terminology used in CoMapeo and the documentation[Notion](https://www.notion.so/1d81b08162d581e3adb9c9b32adb5a95)[Notion](https://www.notion.so/1d81b08162d581e3adb9c9b32adb5a95). Terms like _Observation, Track, Exchange, Coordinator, Participant,_ etc., are explained in simple language. This helps readers, especially those new to digital mapping, to understand the specific meanings in CoMapeo’s context. The glossary is intended to be updated continuously and was noted as WIP, but it will be a part of the support docs for easy lookup of unfamiliar terms.
