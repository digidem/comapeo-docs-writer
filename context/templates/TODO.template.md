# TODOs for this content task

## Open questions
- [ ] <!-- question 1 -->
- [ ] <!-- question 2 -->

## Missing details (to confirm from context)
- [ ] <!-- e.g., Max audio duration â€” not found in context/ -->

## Decisions and rationale
- <!-- brief, link to context file/section if helpful -->

## Sources consulted (context only)
- <!-- list paths used during drafting; referenced.md must include a final Sources line; index.md must not include it -->

## Next steps
- [ ] Draft section
- [ ] Add Sources line to referenced.md with exact paths (ensure index.md has none)
- [ ] Run `context/system/AGENT_CONTENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- [ ] Move final to `./content/` with snake_case naming
