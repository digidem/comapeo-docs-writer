# Installing CoMapeo

Tip: Before installing CoMapeo make sure your phone battery is charged, that you have access to an internet network for downloading CoMapeo and that your phone is virus free. Consider doing a maintenance check on your phone first (see Setting up a Device).

- Step 1: Find CoMapeo on the Playstore. Open Google Playstore and search for CoMapeo, created by Awana Digital. Alternate option: You can also download the .apk for CoMapeo from our website at https://awana.digital/comapeo. However if you download the .apk the app will not be automatically updated with new features and bug fixes when we make new releases. We recommend installing CoMapeo via the Playstore if possible.

- Step 2: Install CoMapeo. Click on the install button on the Playstore listing; this will download and install CoMapeo to your phone.

- Step 3a: Open CoMapeo from Playstore. You can open CoMapeo now from within the Playstore window.

  ![][image3]

- Step 3b: Open CoMapeo from phone. You can also open CoMapeo from the list of apps on your phone where it will now appear.

  ![][image4]

- Step 4: Permission to take photos. CoMapeo will ask for permission to take photos, which is one of the main features of the app. If you don’t grant it permission, you will not be able to use this feature (but other parts of the app will still work).

  ![][image5]

- Step 5a: Permission to access location. CoMapeo needs to access your device’s location in order to collect GPS coordinates to save with your data. If you don’t grant permission you will be able to use other features of the app, and give it access later, or enter GPS coordinates manually. Newer Android versions appear like the image here; in this case, choose Precise location otherwise your data collection might be compromised.

- Step 5b: Permission to access location. Phones with older Android versions will appear like the image here.

- Step 6: Welcome screen. Welcome to CoMapeo. Click the Get Started button to move on.

- Step 7: Data and Privacy. Find out more about how Awana Digital has built CoMapeo to keep your data safe and secure.

  ![][image9]

- Step 8: Learn more about privacy. Click on Learn More for further details on data privacy and what data is sent to Awana Digital to help us improve the app. Here you can also choose to opt in or opt out of sharing diagnostic data. This can also be changed later via Settings > Data Privacy. See Privacy Policy in English: CoMapeo Data & Privacy at https://www.notion.so/CoMapeo-Data-Privacy-d8f413bbbf374a2092655b89b9ceb2b0?pvs=21

  ![][image10]

- Step 9: Name your device. You must enter a name for your device. This is the name other devices will see when inviting you to a project, and will display in the list of project members. It does not have to be your name, but if you are using CoMapeo as part of a team, on a shared project, we recommend that you get an agreement that works for everyone about how you are going to name the devices. For example, you might want to use the name of the person using that particular device, or you might want to use something anonymous for safety issues (like Mapper 1), or you might want to put a sticker on each phone with its name if they are being used by multiple people.

  ![][image11]

- Step 10: Start using CoMapeo. You should get a success screen and then click “Go to Map” to start collecting data. Your first view of CoMapeo should look like this. For support on joining or creating a project with others, see Creating a New Project and Inviting Collaborators. For support on starting to collect data alone, within your Solo Project, see Mapping on your own and next steps.

# Uninstalling CoMapeo

## Reasons for uninstalling CoMapeo

You might want to uninstall CoMapeo for a number of reasons, for example:

- You have decided that the tool isn’t the right one for you
- You are no longer part of certain projects
- You want to give your phone away to someone else
- You think your device and the data are not secure

However, there are irreversible consequences to uninstalling CoMapeo, so make sure you are sure about your reasons, and look at the checklist below before completing the uninstallation.

## Before uninstalling CoMapeo

When you uninstall CoMapeo all the data within the app will be deleted and will not be recoverable. You will also lose access to any projects you are part of, even if you are a coordinator. Therefore please follow these steps before uninstalling CoMapeo.

- If you are not part of any team projects, but are only using CoMapeo on your own, make sure you export any data from within all solo projects you have, or share any individual observation data that you consider important via Whatsapp / email etc. Go to: EXPORT DATA
- If you are part of one or more projects, make sure that you are up to date with your data exchange, so that any data you have collected can be part of the team data. Go to: UNDERSTANDING HOW EXCHANGE WORKS
- If you are a coordinator on a project, make sure that you set up at least one other device as a coordinator device for the project. If you fail to do this then the project will only have participants, and certain actions will not be possible. Go to: Managing a Team

## Uninstalling CoMapeo

- Step 1: Find CoMapeo. Locate CoMapeo in your list of apps, or on your homescreen.

  ![][image4]

- Step 2: Uninstall CoMapeo. Long-press on the icon of CoMapeo to see options, including uninstall.

  ![][image14]

- Step 3: Confirm uninstall.

  ![][image15]

- Step 4: Uninstall successful. CoMapeo is no longer on your phone; you will not find it in your app list or homescreen. All the data held within CoMapeo has been deleted from your phone.

# Troubleshooting

## Deleting your app data

You might want to delete your app data without deleting CoMapeo off your phone. This might be useful if you have come across bugs or want to start fresh with CoMapeo. Clearing data deletes all the contents of the app, and resets it back to its default state, like when it was first installed. If you have limited or no internet access this might be useful, as you can start from scratch by deleting app data, without having to re-download CoMapeo from the Playstore.

## Instructions

Steps might vary slightly depending on Android version, but will be something like:

1. Go to Settings and then Apps & notifications (or just Apps)
2. Tap CoMapeo
3. Tap Storage or Storage & cache and then Clear data (make sure you clear data and not just cache)
4. Confirm that you want to clear the data

On Android 11 and higher, “Clear data” was renamed to “clear storage”. Some older Android versions may also have a Clear data button directly on the app info screen.
