# Templates

This folder contains reusable templates for creating and managing Product Support content.

- `SECTION.template.md` — Authoring template for a content section. Use this to scaffold structure (title, hero image, table of contents, subtitles, steps, troubleshooting) and tone.
- `TODO.template.md` — Per‑task checklist/log. Copy to `TODO.md` next to your draft to track open questions, missing details (TODOs), decisions, sources consulted, and next steps.

Usage

- Start a new section by copying `SECTION.template.md` into your working directory and adapting it to the topic.
- Create a per‑task `TODO.md` from `TODO.template.md` and maintain it during drafting; remove/archive when done.
- Follow `context/STYLE_GUIDE.md` and run `context/AGENT_CONTENT_CHECKLIST.md` before marking work as complete.
