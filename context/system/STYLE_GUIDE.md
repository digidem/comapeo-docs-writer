# CoMapeo PS Docs Content Style Guide

### :comapeo_logo_circle: About this Style Guide

The objective of this Style Guide is to support all contributors in the writing and reviewing process for CoMapeo Product Support materials.

Because materials will be the result of a collaborative process, with contributions from different voices and styles within the Product Support team, we aim to have a shared set of guidelines that gives consistency to the content we create, knowing that it is key to accessibility and clarity for diverse users.

### Tone and language
See `context/system/TONE_GUIDE.md` for voice and language. This Style Guide focuses on structure and formatting.
🟢

### Structure and style

- Consistency is key. If you start describing the steps in one way, stick with it. Remember that this is technical writing, not literary. So don’t be afraid of repeating terms (we want repetition!)
- Add a link to other sections when useful (see “See format for links and highlights in the next block of this guide)
- Avoid brackets or parentheses. If it needs explanation, do it within the context of it.
    - If you want to add a paragraph or a side note, you can use 👉🏾 emoji to add a separate paragraph (see block below)
- Think of your writing as going from general explanations and the most common actions, towards detail and the most unique actions.
    - The structure is there to help you. Follow the main order:
    1. Title
    2. Hero image
    3. Table of contents (in this page we’ll learn…)
    4. Subtitles

## Titles

- Keep them short and simple.
- Use verb action-oriented headers, ie. “Understanding Exchange”.
- Use feature names clearly. Capitalize them and write them in bold.⚪

## Subtitles

- Break down large chunks of text into smaller paragraphs. This makes information more accessible to diverse kinds of readers.
- If your section is more than two paragraphs long, consider adding subtitles to improve readability
- Number step subtitles, consequently, and give them a title of 2-6 .⚫

## Writing with visuals

- As you draft, add ideas for images that will support readers with the content.
- Think of images as complementary -  they support the text but the text should be clear enough alone.
### Questions for PS team

- Should features be capitalized? (Exchange, Multi Projects)
    - Everywhere yes
- Should feature be in bold? (**Exchange, Multi Projects**)
    - only in intro/description paragraph
- Should steps have a title or just be listed as Step1, Step 2 (and so on)?  to explore still
