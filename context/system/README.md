# System: Process and Authoring Guides

This folder mirrors the key process documents used to create content, so authors can reference everything from a single place.

- AGENTS.md — Agent rules and repo workflow guidance (copy of root AGENTS.md).
- AGENT_CONTENT_CHECKLIST.md — Post‑draft checklist for every section.
- STYLE_GUIDE.md — Tone, structure, and formatting rules for content.
- CONTENT_INDEX.txt — Roadmap of sections to produce.
- MATERIALS_INDEX.md — Index of available assets/screenshots.
- templates/ — Authoring templates used for new sections and TODOs.

Notes
- The canonical sources still live at the root (AGENTS.md) and under context/. These copies exist for convenience and stable in‑repo linking.
- When updating any of these documents, update the originals under context/ (or root for AGENTS.md) and then refresh this folder.
