# System Docs Index

Use these files to create consistent, versioned content. Start with PROCESS (once available), then Style, Tone, and the Checklist.

- `STYLE_GUIDE.md` — Structure and formatting rules (titles, sections, visuals). Tone lives in `TONE_GUIDE.md`.
- `TONE_GUIDE.md` — Voice and language (imperative, concise, active, callouts).
- `AGENT_CONTENT_CHECKLIST.md` — Post‑draft QA (roadmap/source lookup, citations, assets, naming, readability).
- `PROCESS.md` — End‑to‑end workflow and folder map.

Related indexes
- Sources map: `context/sources/INDEX.md` — where to find quickstarts, legacy docs, setup, screenshots, videos.
- Roadmap: `context/content_deck/INDEX.md` — authoritative topic/section ordering and summaries.

Notes
- Templates are immutable: copy from `context/templates/` when creating a new version; never edit templates in place.
- Cite only files under `context/`; put “Sources:” only in `referenced.md`. See the Checklist.
