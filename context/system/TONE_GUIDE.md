# CoMapeo PS Docs Tone Guide

This guide defines how we speak to readers. It complements the Style Guide and focuses only on tone and language. For structure, formatting, and process, refer to `context/system/STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `context/system/PROCESS.md` (once available).

Audience (orientation only)
- Write for a mixed audience: new or upgrading CoMapeo users (some from Mapeo), with varied tech confidence.
- Assume general app literacy; do not over‑explain basics. Keep content practical and respectful.

Core tone principles
- **Clear and Concrete**: Use clear, concrete words to describe features. Be as literal as possible (e.g., use "Wi-Fi router" instead of just "Wi-Fi" to avoid implying internet necessity).
- **Imperative and Action-Oriented**: Use commands for steps: "Press XX then go to XX". Avoid "This action will take you to...".
- **Straightforward and Concise**:
  - Avoid expressive tone (!) and adjectives.
  - Use simple, everyday terms.
  - Avoid complicated clauses.
  - Say less: Write short sentences. Focus on what users need to know first; add details only if relevant.
- **Active Voice**: Avoid passive constructions.
- **Consistent Wording**: Repeat the exact term for the same thing; do not use synonyms for variety.

Voice and person
- Address the reader directly when it helps action (“You can…”, “Tap…”), but prefer imperative without excess “you”.
- Present tense for steps and descriptions; past only when describing outcomes (“The observation appears in…”).

Plain language and inclusivity
- Prefer everyday words; avoid idioms and culture‑specific references.
- Expand uncommon acronyms on first mention if not obvious to general users.
- Be explicit when prerequisites or roles matter (e.g., “Only Coordinators can…”).

Highlights and callouts (usage)
- 💡 Tip — helpful but non‑essential advice.
- 👉🏾 More — short side note you would otherwise place in parentheses.

Headings (tone aspects)
- Titles are short, action‑oriented (“Understanding Exchange”, “Creating a New Track”).
- Sub‑headings help scannability; prefer descriptive phrases over questions.

Steps and flows
- Number steps when a sequence exists; each step line starts with a verb.
- Keep each step self‑contained; reference related sections with “🔗 Go to …” when helpful.

Examples (before → after)
- “This action will take you to the next screen where you would be able to save.” → “Tap Save.”
- “Using Wi‑Fi, you can Exchange.” → “Connect devices to the same Wi‑Fi router. Open Exchange.”

Do / Don’t
- Do: be direct, concrete, and consistent; use active voice; keep sentences short.
- Don’t: add hype, use exclamation marks, or switch terms for the same feature.

Source alignment
- These tone rules are extracted from the Language/Tone and related sections of the Style Guide and the section templates. If a conflict arises, Style Guide wins for formatting; Tone Guide wins for voice.
